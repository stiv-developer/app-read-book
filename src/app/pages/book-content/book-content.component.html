                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h4>My Story</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>On the final day of my sophomore year of high school, I was hit in the face with a
                        baseball bat. As my classmate took a full swing, the bat slipped out of his hands
                        and came flying toward me before striking me directly between the eyes. I have
                        no memory of the moment of impact.</p>
                    <p>The bat smashed into my face with such force that it crushed my nose into a
                        distorted U-shape. The collision sent the soft tissue of my brain slamming into
                        the inside of my skull. Immediately, a wave of swelling surged throughout my
                        head. In a fraction of a second, I had a broken nose, multiple skull fractures, and
                        two shattered eye sockets.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I opened my eyes, I saw people staring at me and running over to help.
                        I looked down and noticed spots of red on my clothes. One of my classmates
                        took the shirt off his back and handed it to me. I used it to plug the stream of
                        blood rushing from my broken nose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of
                        how seriously I had been injured.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long walk to
                        the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into school. Random
                        hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked
                        slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions.
                        “What year is it?”
                        “1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.
                        “Who is the president of the United States?”
                        “Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.
                        “What is your mom’s name?”
                        “Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.
                        “Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to
                        remember my own mother’s name.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid
                        swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived.
                        Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital.
                        Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic
                        functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day. Then I
                        stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me with oxygen,
                        they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle the situation and
                        ordered a helicopter to fly me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad across
                        the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me
                        along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother, who had
                        arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside
                        me. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held my
                        hand during the flight.
                    </p>
                    <p>While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went home to
                        check on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked back
                        tears as he explained to my sister that he would miss her eighth-grade graduation
                        ceremony that night. After passing my siblings off to family and friends, he
                        drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother.</p>
                    <p>When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly
                        twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into the
                        trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe that I
                        was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed to be
                        fixed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure
                        my third of the day I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a
                        ventilator.</p>
                    <p>
                        My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had
                        entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed with
                        leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six months old.
                        After two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone
                        marrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy,
                        healthy, and cancer free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents
                        found themselves back in the same place with a different child.
                    </p>
                    <p>While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to
                        comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a decade
                        earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents slept
                        restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse from fatigue,
                        the next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother would tell me later,
                        “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>My recovery</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Mercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point where
                        the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma. When I finally
                        regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to smell. As a test,
                        a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff an apple juice box. My sense of
                        smell returned, but—to everyone’s surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced
                        air through the fractures in my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My
                        eyeball bulged out of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the
                        optic nerve attaching my eye to my brain</p>
                    <p>The ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place as the
                        air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take. I was scheduled
                        for surgery one week later, which would allow me some additional time to heal.
                        I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a boxing match, but I was cleared
                        to leave the hospital. I returned home with a broken nose, half a dozen facial
                        fractures, and a bulging left eye.
                    </p>
                    <p>The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on
                        pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see straight. It took
                        more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to its normal location.
                        Between the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months before I could
                        drive a car again. At physical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like
                        walking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but
                        there were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and overwhelmed.
                    </p>
                    <p>I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to the
                        baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part of my life.
                        My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I had a
                        dream of playing professionally, too. After months of rehabilitation, what I
                        wanted more than anything was to get back on the field.</p>
                    <p>But my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled around, I
                        was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I was sent down to
                        play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had been playing since age four,
                        and for someone who had spent so much time and effort on the sport, getting cut
                        was humiliating. I vividly remember the day it happened. I sat in my car and
                        cried as I flipped through the radio, desperately searching for a song that would
                        make me feel better.
                    </p>
                    <p>After a year of self-doubt, I managed to make the varsity team as a senior, but
                        I rarely made it on the field. In total, I played eleven innings of high school
                        varsity baseball, barely more than a single game.
                    </p>
                    <p>Despite my lackluster high school career, I still believed I could become a
                        great player. And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one
                        responsible for making it happen. The turning point came two years after my
                        injury, when I began college at Denison University. It was a new beginning, and
                        it was the place where I would discover the surprising power of small habits for
                        the first time.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>How I learned about habits</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Attending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a spot on
                        the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the roster as a freshman, I
                        was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high school years, I had managed to
                        become a college athlete.</p>
                    <p>I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I focused
                        on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and played video
                        games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy
                        world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These
                        improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I
                        started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the
                        classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s
                        during my first year.</p>
                    <p>A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many
                        cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but
                        consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me
                        when I started. For example, for the first time in my life, I made it a habit to lift
                        weights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed, my six-footfour-inch frame
                        bulked
                        up from a featherweight 170 to a lean 200 pounds.
                    </p>
                    <p>When my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the pitching
                        staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the end of the season, I
                        was selected for the all-conference team. But it was not until my senior season
                        that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits really began to
                        pay off.
                    </p>
                    <p>Six years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the
                        hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at
                        Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—an
                        honor given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I
                        graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories.
                        That same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honor, the
                        President’s Medal.</p>
                    <p>I hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there was
                        nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never ended up playing
                        professionally. However, looking back on those years, I believe I accomplished
                        something just as rare: I fulfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this
                        book can help you fulfill your potential as well.</p>
                    <p>We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience
                        taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will
                        compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years.
                        We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often
                        depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with
                        the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight. I don’t
                        know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. There wasn’t one defining
                        moment on my journey from medically induced coma to Academic AllAmerican; there were many. It
                        was a
                        gradual evolution, a long series of small
                        wins and tiny breakthroughs. The only way I made progress—the only choice I
                        had—was to start small. And I employed this same strategy a few years later
                        when I started my own business and began working on this book.

                <h4>How and why I wrote this book</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For years, I
                        had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with habits and I was
                        finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began by publishing a new article
                        every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led
                        to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number
                        had grown to more than thirty thousand people.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand subscribers,
                        which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the internet. I had felt
                        like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was
                        becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that excited me but also
                        felt uncomfortable. I had never considered myself a master of the topic, but
                        rather someone who was experimenting alongside my readers.</p>
                    <p>In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a book
                        deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are reading
                        now. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was increasingly
                        asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit formation, behavior
                        change, and continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote
                        speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.
                    </p>
                    <p>In 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications like Time,
                        Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read by over eight million
                        people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB began reading my work
                        and sharing it with their teams.</p>
                    <p>At the start of 2017, I launched the Habits Academy, which became the
                        premier training platform for organizations and individuals interested in building
                        better habits in life and work.* Fortune 500 companies and growing start-ups
                        began to enroll their leaders and train their staff. In total, over ten thousand
                        leaders, managers, coaches, and teachers have graduated from the Habits
                        Academy, and my work with them has taught me an incredible amount about
                        what it takes to make habits work in the real world.
                    </p>
                    <p>As I put the finishing touches on this book in 2018, jamesclear.com is
                        receiving millions of visitors per month and nearly five hundred thousand people
                        subscribe to my weekly email newsletter—a number that is so far beyond my
                        expectations when I began that I’m not even sure what to think of it.</p>
                </div>
                <h4>How this book will benefit you</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book,
                        you must first become the book.” I originally learned about the ideas mentioned
                        here because I had to live them. I had to rely on small habits to rebound from my
                        injury, to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a high level on the field, to
                        become a writer, to build a successful business, and simply to develop into a
                        responsible adult. Small habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you
                        picked up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building better
                        habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science supports
                        everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research paper; it’s an
                        operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical advice front and center as I
                        explain the science of how to create and change your habits in a way that is easy
                        to understand and apply</p>
                    <p>The fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and
                        more—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the
                        best ideas smart people figured out a long time ago as well as the most
                        compelling discoveries scientists have made recently. My contribution, I hope, is
                        to find the ideas that matter most and connect them in a way that is highly
                        actionable. Anything wise in these pages you should credit to the many experts
                        who preceded me. Anything foolish, assume it is my error.
                    </p>
                    <p>The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving,
                        response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of
                        these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these
                        terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus,
                        response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more
                        recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg.</p>
                    <p>Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward
                        or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s
                        model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our
                        habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs
                        impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. In
                        recent decades, scientists have begun to determine the connection between our
                        thoughts, feelings, and behavior. This research will also be covered in these
                        pages</p>
                    <p>In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and
                        behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to
                        accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal
                        emotions on our habits. While some of the language may be familiar, I am
                        confident that the details—and the applications of the Four Laws of Behavior
                        Change—will offer a new way to think about your habits</p>
                    <p>Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to
                        moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s
                        about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting principles you can rely
                        on year after year. The ideas you can build a business around, build a family
                        around, build a life around.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes the
                        best way I know—an approach that will be effective regardless of where you
                        start or what you’re trying to change. The strategies I cover will be relevant to
                        anyone looking for a step-by-step system for improvement, whether your goals
                        center on health, money, productivity, relationships, or all of the above. As long
                        as human behavior is involved, this book will be your guide.</p>

                <h2>Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference</h2>
                <h4>The surprising power of atomic habits</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The fate of British Cycling changed one day in 2003. The organization, which was
                        the governing body for professional cycling in Great Britain, had recently hired
                        Dave Brailsford as its new performance director. At the time, professional
                        cyclists in Great Britain had endured nearly one hundred years of mediocrity.
                        Since 1908, British riders had won just a single gold medal at the Olympic
                        Games, and they had fared even worse in cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de
                        France. In 110 years, no British cyclist had ever won the event.
                    </p>
                    <p>In fact, the performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one
                        of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because
                        they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using
                        their gear.
                    </p>
                    <p>Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What
                        made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a
                        strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the
                        philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.
                        Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down
                        everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by
                        1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.”</p>
                    <p>Brailsford and his coaches began by making small adjustments you might
                        expect from a professional cycling team. They redesigned the bike seats to make
                        them more comfortable and rubbed alcohol on the tires for a better grip. They
                        asked riders to wear electrically heated overshorts to maintain ideal muscle
                        temperature while riding and used biofeedback sensors to monitor how each
                        athlete responded to a particular workout. The team tested various fabrics in a
                        wind tunnel and had their outdoor riders switch to indoor racing suits, which
                        proved to be lighter and more aerodynamic.</p>
                    <p>But they didn’t stop there. Brailsford and his team continued to find 1 percent
                        improvements in overlooked and unexpected areas. They tested different types
                        of massage gels to see which one led to the fastest muscle recovery. They hired a
                        surgeon to teach each rider the best way to wash their hands to reduce the
                        chances of catching a cold. They determined the type of pillow and mattress that
                        led to the best night’s sleep for each rider. They even painted the inside of the
                        team truck white, which helped them spot little bits of dust that would normally
                        slip by unnoticed but could degrade the performance of the finely tuned bikes.</p>
                    <p>As these and hundreds of other small improvements accumulated, the results
                        came faster than anyone could have imagined.
                    </p>
                    <p>Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated
                        the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where
                        they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. Four years
                        later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they
                        set nine Olympic records and seven world records.</p>
                    <p>That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the
                        Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he
                        would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British team five
                        Tour de France victories in six years.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world
                        championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured
                        five Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful
                        run in cycling history.</p>
                    <p>How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes
                        transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would
                        seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small improvements
                        accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this
                        approach in your own life?
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h4>Why small habits make a big diference</h4>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and
                        underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too
                        often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
                        Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a
                        championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to
                        make some earth-shattering improvement that everyone will talk about.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it
                        isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long
                        run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.
                        Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one
                        year, you’ll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you’re done.
                        Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you’ll decline
                        nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates
                        into something much more.
                    </p>
                    <p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way that
                        money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply
                        as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet
                        the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only
                        when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good
                        habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly apparent.</p>
                    <p>This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss
                        small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If
                        you save a little money now, you’re still not a millionaire. If you go to the gym
                        three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an hour
                        tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few changes, but the
                        results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous
                        routines.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad
                        habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn’t move much. If
                        you work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you
                        procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow, there will usually be time
                        to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss.
                    </p>
                    <p>But when we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor
                        decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small
                        choices compound into toxic results. It’s the accumulation of many missteps—a
                        1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem.</p>
                    <p>The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of
                        shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying
                        from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the
                        heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of
                        New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the
                        airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United
                        States, you end up hundreds of miles apart.</p>
                    <p>Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits can guide your life to a very
                        different destination. Making a choice that is 1 percent better or 1 percent worse
                        seems insignificant in the moment, but over the span of moments that make up a
                        lifetime these choices determine the difference between who you are and who
                        you could be. Success is the product of daily habits—not once-in-a-lifetime
                        transformations.</p>
                    <p>That said, it doesn’t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now.
                        What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success.
                        You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your
                        current results. If you’re a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each
                        month, then you’re on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don’t change, it’s
                        not going to end well. Conversely, if you’re broke, but you save a little bit every
                        month, then you’re on the path toward financial freedom—even if you’re
                        moving slower than you’d like.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a
                        lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of
                        your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.
                        Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you
                        repeat.
                        If you want to predict where you’ll end up in life, all you have to do is follow
                        the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will
                        compound ten or twenty years down the line. Are you spending less than you
                        earn each month? Are you making it into the gym each week? Are you reading
                        books and learning something new each day? Tiny battles like these are the ones
                        that will define your future self.
                    </p>
                    <p>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply
                        whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time
                        your enemy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Habits are a double-edged sword. Bad habits can cut you down just as easily
                        as good habits can build you up, which is why understanding the details is
                        crucial. You need to know how habits work and how to design them to your
                        liking, so you can avoid the dangerous half of the blade.</p>

                <h2>Make It Obvious</h2>
                <h3>The man who din't look right</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The psychologist Gary Klein once told me a story about a woman who attended a
                        family gathering. She had spent years working as a paramedic and, upon arriving
                        at the event, took one look at her father-in-law and got very concerned.
                        “I don’t like the way you look,” she said.
                    </p>
                    <p>Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied, “Well, I
                        don’t like your looks, either.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”
                    </p>
                    <p>A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after an
                        examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and was at
                        immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-law’s intuition, he
                        could have died.</p>
                    <p>What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart attack?
                        When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood to
                        critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the skin.
                        The result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face. After
                        many years of working with people with heart failure, the woman had
                        unknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on sight. She
                        couldn’t explain what it was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she
                        knew something was wrong.</p>
                    <p>Similar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts can identify
                        which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile and which one is a plane from
                        their own fleet even though they are traveling at the same speed, flying at the
                        same altitude, and look identical on radar in nearly every respect. During the
                        Gulf War, Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship
                        when he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly like
                        the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but even his
                        superior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.</p>
                    <p>Museum curators have been known to discern the difference between an
                        authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they
                        can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off. Experienced radiologists
                        can look at a brain scan and predict the area where a stroke will develop before
                        any obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye. I’ve even heard of
                        hairdressers noticing whether a client is pregnant based only on the feel of her
                        hair.
                    </p>
                    <p>The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your
                        surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. Whenever you
                        experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart
                        attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen—your brain
                        begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and highlighting
                        the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.
                    </p>
                    <p>With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain
                        outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain
                        encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain what it
                        is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability
                        to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit
                        you have.</p>
                    <p>We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without thinking.
                        You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your lungs to breathe, or
                        your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles all this and more on
                        autopilot. You are much more than your conscious self.</p>
                    <p>Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t
                        necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time to eat.
                        Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body has a variety of
                        feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to eat again and that track
                        what is going on around you and within you. Cravings can arise thanks to
                        hormones and chemicals circulating through your body. Suddenly, you’re
                        hungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you off.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to
                        be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take
                        action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits
                        useful.</p>
                    <p>It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come
                        under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old
                        patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out, you
                        may not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand whenever you laugh,
                        that you apologize before asking a question, or that you have a habit of finishing
                        other people’s sentences. And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely
                        you become to question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>I once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift cards
                        after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day, the clerk cashed
                        out a few customers in a row who purchased with gift cards. When the next
                        person walked up, the clerk swiped the customer’s actual credit card, picked up
                        the scissors, and then cut it in half—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at
                        the stunned customer and realizing what had just happened.</p>
                    <p>Another woman I came across in my research was a former preschool teacher
                        who had switched to a corporate job. Even though she was now working with
                        adults, her old habits would kick in and she kept asking coworkers if they had
                        washed their hands after going to the bathroom. I also found the story of a man
                        who had spent years working as a lifeguard and would occasionally yell “Walk!”
                        whenever he saw a child running</p>
                    <p>Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are
                        essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to
                        the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so deeply
                        encoded that it may feel like the urge to act comes from nowhere. For this
                        reason, we must begin the process of behavior change with awareness.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our
                        current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is
                        firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit
                        remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung
                        said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you
                        will call it fate.”</p>

                </div>
                <h3>The best way to start a new habit</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In 2001, Researchers S in Great Britain began working with 248 people to build better
                        exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The subjects were divided into
                        three groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how
                        often they exercised.
                    </p>
                    <p>The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not only to
                        track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise.
                        The researchers also explained to the group how exercise could reduce the risk
                        of coronary heart disease and improve heart health.</p>
                    <p>Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same
                        presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of
                        motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and
                        where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member
                        of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I
                        will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in
                        [PLACE].”</p>
                    <p>In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least
                        once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second
                        group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior.) But 91 percent of the
                        third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.
                        The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation
                        intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act.
                        That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit</p>
                    <p>The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of
                        your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the
                        sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and
                        location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.</p>
                    <p>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:
                        “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective
                        for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date of
                        when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of your colonoscopy
                        appointment. They increase the odds that people will stick with habits like
                        recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and stopping smoking.
                    </p>
                    <p>Researchers have even found that voter turnout increases when people are
                        forced to create implementation intentions by answering questions like: “What
                        route are you taking to the polling station? At what time are you planning to go?
                        What bus will get you there?” Other successful government programs have
                        prompted citizens to make a clear plan to send taxes in on time or provided
                        directions on when and where to pay late traffic bills.</p>
                    <p>The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where
                        they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Too many
                        people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell
                        ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we
                        never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to
                        chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the
                        right time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want
                        to work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote” and
                        transforms them into a concrete plan of action.</p>
                    <p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.
                        It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their
                        entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for
                        inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I meditate this
                        morning or at lunch? When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to
                        make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.</p>
                    <h4>The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this
                        sentence:</h4>
                    <h4>I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</h4>
                    <p>Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.</p>
                    <p>Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my
                        bedroom.</p>
                    <p>Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym</p>
                    <p>Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.</p>
                    <p>If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week,
                        month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope
                        is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start
                        feels motivating.</p>
                    <p>There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific about
                        what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail
                        progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. We often say yes to
                        little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing
                        instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all
                        day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.</p>
                    <p>Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make
                        the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to
                        do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. As the writer
                        Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without
                        conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get
                        antsy around the time of day you normally work out.”</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life and work.
                        My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford professor BJ Fogg and it is
                        a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.
                    </p>
                    <h4>HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS</h4>
                    <p>The French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in poverty, but
                        that all changed one day in 1765.</p>
                    <p>Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford to pay for
                        the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known for his role as
                        the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of the most comprehensive
                        encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia,
                        heard of Diderot’s financial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a book
                        lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s
                        personal library for £1,000—more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had
                        money to spare. With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also
                        acquired a scarlet robe for himself.</p>
                    <p>Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately
                        noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common
                        possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no
                        more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with
                        one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He
                        bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed
                        aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase
                        led to the next.
                    </p>
                    <p>Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to
                        lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that
                        obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to
                        additional purchases.</p>
                    <p>You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to get new
                        shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly question the layout
                        of your entire living room. You buy a toy for your child and soon find yourself
                        purchasing all of the accessories that go with it. It’s a chain reaction of
                        purchases.</p>
                    <p>Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next
                        based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the bathroom leads to
                        washing and drying your hands, which reminds you that you need to put the
                        dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundry detergent to the shopping list, and
                        so on. No behavior happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers
                        the next behavior.</p>
                    <p>Why is this important?
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of
                        behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to
                        identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new
                        behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
                    </p>
                    <p>Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than
                        pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a
                        current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny
                        Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.</p>
                    <h4>The habit stacking formula is:</h4>
                    <h4>“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”</h4>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p>Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will
                        meditate for one minute.
                    </p>
                    <p>Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change
                        into my workout clothes.</p>
                    <p>Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m grateful
                        for that happened today.
                    </p>
                    <p>Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a kiss</p>
                    <p>Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or family
                        member where I am running and how long it will take.
                    </p>
                    <p>The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each
                        day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger
                        stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of
                        the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a
                        positive version of the Diderot Effect.
                    </p>
                    <h4>HABIT STACKING</h4>
                    <p>Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:
                    </p>
                    <p>After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty
                        seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the
                        day.</p>
                    <p>After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my
                        first task.
                    </p>
                    <p>Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:</p>
                    <p>After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the
                        dishwasher.</p>
                    <p>After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the counter.</p>
                    <p>After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for
                        tomorrow morning.</p>
                    <p>You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current routines.
                        For example, you may already have a morning routine that looks like this: Wake
                        up > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let’s say you want to develop the habit of
                        reading more each night. You can expand your habit stack and try something
                        like: Wake up > Make my bed > Place a book on my pillow > Take a shower.
                        Now, when you climb into bed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting
                        for you to enjoy.</p>
                    <p>Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that guide
                        your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for which action
                        should come next. Once you get comfortable with this approach, you can
                        develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever the situation is appropriate:</p>
                    <p>Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of using
                        the elevator.</p>
                    <p>Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to
                        someone I don’t know yet.</p>
                    <p>Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait
                        twenty-four hours before purchasing.
                    </p>
                    <p>Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put veggies
                        on my plate first.</p>
                    <p>Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.
                        (“One in, one out.”)
                    </p>
                    <p>Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and smile
                        before answering.</p>
                    <p>Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table and
                        chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.
                    </p>
                    <p>No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a successful habit
                        stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off. Unlike an implementation
                        intention, which specifically states the time and location for a given behavior,
                        habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it. When and where
                        you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. If
                        you’re trying to add meditation into your morning routine but mornings are
                        chaotic and your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrong
                        place and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful. Don’t ask
                        yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with something else.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. If you
                        want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit that only happens
                        on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.</p>
                    <p>One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list
                        of your current habits. You can use your Habits Scorecard from the last chapter
                        as a starting point. Alternatively, you can create a list with two columns. In the
                        first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail.*</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <p>Get out of bed.</p>
                    <p>Take a shower</p>
                    <p>Brush your teeth.</p>
                    <p>Get dressed.</p>
                    <p>Brew a cup of coffee.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eat breakfast.
                    </p>
                    <p>Take the kids to school.
                    </p>
                    <p>Start the work day.
                    </p>
                    <p>Eat lunch.</p>
                    <p>End the work day.</p>
                    <p>Change out of work clothes.</p>
                    <p>Sit down for dinner.</p>
                    <p>Turn off the lights.</p>
                    <p>Get into bed.</p>
                    <p>Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second column,
                        write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail. For
                        example:</p>
                    <p>The sun rises.
                    </p>
                    <p>You get a text message.</p>
                    <p>The song you are listening to ends.</p>
                    <p>The sun sets.
                    </p>
                    <p>Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer
                        your new habit into your lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately
                        actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I made this mistake
                        myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my habit stack was “When I take
                        a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.” At first glance, this sounded
                        reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger was unclear. Would I do my push-ups
                        before I ate lunch? After I ate lunch? Where would I do them? After a few
                        inconsistent days, I changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for
                        lunch, I will do ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.</p>
                    <p>Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these goals do
                        not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific and clear: After I
                        close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit down at the table. The
                        specificity is important. The more tightly bound your new habit is to a specific
                        cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the time comes to act.

                    <p>The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like
                        implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways
                        to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and
                        where to take action.

                <h3>Motivation is Overrated; environment often matters more</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Anne Thorndike, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in
                        Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve the eating habits of
                        thousands of hospital staff and visitors without changing their willpower or
                        motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she didn’t plan on talking to them at all.
                        Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the “choice
                        architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. They started by changing how drinks were
                        arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash
                        registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. The researchers added water
                        as an option to each one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next
                        to the food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary
                        refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations.</p>
                    <p>Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital dropped
                        by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased by 25.8 percent.
                        They made similar adjustments—and saw similar results—with the food in the
                        cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.
                    </p>
                    <h4>BEFORE AFTER</h4>
                    <p>People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of
                        where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of cookies on the
                        counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if I hadn’t been thinking
                        about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily feel hungry. If the communal table
                        at the office is always filled with doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not
                        to grab one every now and then. Your habits change depending on the room you
                        are in and the cues in front of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our
                        unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under
                        certain environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On
                        a dark street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form
                        of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us.
                        Every habit is context dependent.</p>
                    <p>In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a
                        powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment,
                        or B = f (P,E).</p>
                    <p>It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In 1952, the
                        economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse
                        Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and
                        visualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will occasionally buy
                        products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to
                        them.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than those down
                        near the floor. For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand names featured in
                        easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because they drive the most profit, while
                        cheaper alternatives are tucked away in harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for
                        end caps, which are the units at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking
                        machines for retailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of
                        foot traffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically from
                        end-of-the-aisle racks.
                    </p>
                    <p>The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely you are
                        to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and visit Starbucks
                        because it is on every corner. We like to think that we are in control. If we
                        choose water over soda, we assume it is because we wanted to do so. The truth,
                        however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by
                        purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.</p>
                    <p>Every living being has its own methods for sensing and understanding the
                        world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision. Snakes can smell by
                        “tasting the air” with their highly sensitive tongues. Sharks can detect small
                        amounts of electricity and vibrations in the water caused by nearby fish. Even
                        bacteria have chemoreceptors—tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect toxic
                        chemicals in their environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system. We perceive
                        the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste. But we also have other
                        ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious, but many are nonconscious. For
                        instance, you can “notice” when the temperature drops before a storm, or when
                        the pain in your gut rises during a stomachache, or when you fall off balance
                        while walking on rocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range
                        of internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to drink
                        when thirsty.
                    </p>
                    <p>The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. The
                        human body has about eleven million sensory receptors. Approximately ten
                        million of those are dedicated to sight. Some experts estimate that half of the
                        brain’s resources are used on vision. Given that we are more dependent on vision
                        than on any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the
                        greatest catalyst of our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see
                        can lead to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how
                        important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with productive
                        cues and devoid of unproductive ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don’t have to be the victim
                        of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.</p>
                    <h4>How to design your environment for success</h4>
                    <p>During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch researchers began
                        to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage. In one suburb near
                        Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners used 30 percent less energy than
                        their neighbors—despite the homes being of similar size and getting electricity
                        for the same price.</p>
                    <p>It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical except for
                        one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had one in the basement.
                        Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway. As you may guess,
                        the homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity.
                        When their energy use was obvious and easy to track, people changed their
                        behavior.</p>
                    <p>Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that
                        stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make
                        it easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the
                        behavior. It’s easy not to practice the guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet.
                        It’s easy not to read a book when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest
                        room. It’s easy not to take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry.
                        When the cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.</p>
                    <p>By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a
                        desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in
                        Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each
                        urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they aimed for what they
                        thought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced
                        “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut
                        bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.</p>
                    <p>I’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to buy
                        apples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the refrigerator,
                        and forget all about them. By the time I remembered, the apples would have
                        gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I bought a
                        large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen counter. The next
                        time I bought apples, that was where they went—out in the open where I could
                        see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a few apples each day simply
                        because they were obvious rather than out of sight.</p>
                    <p>Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues
                        for your preferred habits more obvious:
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your
                        pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.</p>
                    <p>If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand
                        in the middle of the living room.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of
                        stationery on your desk.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each
                        morning and place them in common locations around the house.</p>
                    <p>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of
                        your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.
                        Consider how many different ways a smoker could be prompted to pull out a
                        cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend smoke, feeling stressed at work, and
                        so on.
                    </p>
                    <p>The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers
                        throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your
                        habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one.
                        Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for good habits are
                        right in front of you.</p>
                    <p>Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage
                        with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people live in a world
                        others have created for them. But you can alter the spaces where you live and
                        work to increase your exposure to positive cues and reduce your exposure to
                        negative ones. Environment design allows you to take back control and become
                        the architect of your life. Be the designer of your world and not merely the
                        consumer of it.</p>
                    <h4>The context is the cue</h4>
                    <p>The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits
                        become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context
                        surrounding the behavior.</p>
                    <p>For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would
                        ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation:
                        watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the beers
                        on tap.
                    </p>
                    <p>We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur: the home,
                        the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and
                        routines. You establish a particular relationship with the objects on your desk,
                        the items on your kitchen counter, the things in your bedroom.</p>
                    <p>Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our
                        relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the influence of
                        the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about your environment as
                        filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Think in
                        terms of how you interact with the spaces around you. For one person, her couch
                        is the place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch
                        is where he watches television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different
                        people can have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with
                        the same place.
                    </p>
                    <p>The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a
                        particular context.</p>
                    <p>In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only when they
                        were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit in a different room
                        until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects began to associate the context of
                        their bed with the action of sleeping, and it became easier to quickly fall asleep
                        when they climbed in bed. Their brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on
                        their phones, not watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only
                        action that happened in that room.
                    </p>
                    <p>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier
                        to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues
                        that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place—a different coffee
                        shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use—and create a
                        new routine there.</p>
                    <p>It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build a new
                        habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to bed early if you
                        watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be hard to study in the living
                        room without getting distracted if that’s where you always play video games.
                        But when you step outside your normal environment, you leave your behavioral
                        biases behind. You aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new
                        habits to form without interruption.
                    </p>
                    <p>Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a
                        building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do
                        your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.</p>
                    <p>Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your regular
                        supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to avoid unhealthy
                        food when your brain doesn’t automatically know where it is located in the store.
                        When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or
                        rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise,
                        entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.”</p>
                    <p>When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work from my
                        couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very difficult to stop
                        working. There was no clear division between the end of work time and the
                        beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table my office or the space where I
                        ate meals? Was the couch where I relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything
                        happened in the same place.
                    </p>
                    <p>A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a separate
                        room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here” and
                        personal life was something that happened “out there.” It was easier for me to
                        turn off the professional side of my brain when there was a clear dividing line
                        between work life and home life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen
                        was for cooking. The office was for working.</p>
                    <p>Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When
                        you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will
                        usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is
                        both a strength and a weakness. You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks,
                        which makes it a powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do
                        nearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be
                        productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check email, and
                        play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.</p>
                    <p>You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York City. My
                        apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to play multiple roles.”
                        Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your room into activity zones: a
                        chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table for eating. You can do the same with
                        your digital spaces. I know a writer who uses his computer only for writing, his
                        tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every
                        habit should have a home.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become
                        associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under
                        predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes automatically when you are
                        sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed
                        for that purpose. Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in
                        your bedroom. If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an
                        environment that is stable and predictable.</p>
                    <p>A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is an
                        environment where habits can easily form.

                    <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
                    <p>Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over
                        time.</p>
                    <p>Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that
                        stand out.</p>
                    <p>Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.</p>
                    <p>Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but
                        with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes
                        the cue.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are
                        not fighting against old cues.</p>

                <h3>The secret to self-control</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In 1971, as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year, congressmen
                        Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a
                        discovery that stunned the American public. While visiting the troops, they had
                        learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts.
                        Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had
                        tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was even
                        worse than they had initially thought.</p>
                    <p>The discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including the creation
                        of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under President Nixon to
                        promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service members
                        when they returned home.</p>
                    <p>Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that completely
                        upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers
                        who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became readdicted within a year,
                        and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other
                        words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam
                        eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.</p>
                    <p>This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered
                        heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins
                        revealed that addictions could spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical
                        change in the environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by
                        cues triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by the
                        constant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers who were also
                        heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home. Once a soldier
                        returned to the United States, though, he found himself in an environment devoid
                        of those triggers. When the context changed, so did the habit.</p>
                    <p>Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone becomes
                        addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean—which is devoid
                        of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then returns to their old
                        neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused them to get addicted in
                        the first place. It’s no wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact
                        opposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users
                        become re-addicted once they return home from rehab.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad
                        habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior
                        as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a smoker, or an addict, you’ve been
                        told your entire life that it is because you lack self-control—maybe even that
                        you’re a bad person. The idea that a little bit of discipline would solve all our
                        problems is deeply embedded in our culture.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists
                        analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those
                        individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead,
                        “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not
                        require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in
                        tempting situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it
                        the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very
                        often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the
                        way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined
                        person, but by creating a more disciplined environment.</p>
                    <p>This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what
                        happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in
                        the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises. When Patty
                        Olwell, a therapist from Austin, Texas, started smoking, she would often light up
                        while riding horses with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it
                        for years. She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse
                        again and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever. The cues
                        were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the
                        environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change techniques can
                        backfire. Shaming obese people with weight-loss presentations can make them
                        feel stressed, and as a result many people return to their favorite coping strategy:
                        overeating. Showing pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher
                        levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not
                        careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.</p>
                    <p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings
                        they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food,
                        you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more
                        television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. Worrying
                        about your health makes you feel anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease
                        your anxiety, which makes your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more
                        anxious. It’s a downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.
                    </p>
                    <p>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external
                        trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice
                        something, you begin to want it. This process is happening all the time—often
                        without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing addicts a picture of
                        cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the
                        brain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously
                        register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved
                        the drug all the same.</p>
                    <p>Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it.
                        Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are
                        nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go unused for quite a while.
                        And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is
                        hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too
                        much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the
                        long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it
                        bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a
                        negative environment.</p>
                    <p>A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the
                        most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that
                        causes it.</p>
                    <p>If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another
                        room for a few hours.</p>
                    <p>If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following
                        social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.</p>
                    <p>If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out
                        of the bedroom.</p>
                    <p>If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading
                        reviews of the latest tech gear.</p>
                    <p>If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it
                        in a closet after each use.</p>
                    <p>This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than
                        make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I’m often surprised by how effective
                        simple changes like these can be. Remove a single cue and the entire habit often
                        fades away.
                    </p>
                    <p>Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to
                        resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can muster the willpower to
                        override your desires every time. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower
                        whenever you want to do the right thing, your energy would be better spent
                        optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of
                        your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</p>

                <h2>Make It Attractive</h2>
                <h3>How to make a habit irresistible</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In the 1940S, a Dutch scientist named Niko Tinbergen performed a series of
                        experiments that transformed our understanding of what motivates us. Tinbergen
                        —who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his work—was investigating herring
                        gulls, the gray and white birds often seen flying along the seashores of North
                        America.</p>
                    <p>Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and Tinbergen noticed
                        that newly hatched chicks would peck this spot whenever they wanted food. To
                        begin one experiment, he created a collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a
                        head without a body. When the parents had flown away, he went over to the nest
                        and offered these dummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes,
                        and he assumed the baby birds would reject them altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard beak, they
                        pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother. They had a clear
                        preference for those red spots—as if they had been genetically programmed at
                        birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the bigger the red spot, the faster the
                        chicks pecked. Eventually, he created a beak with three large red dots on it.
                        When he placed it over the nest, the baby birds went crazy with delight. They
                        pecked at the little red patches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.
                        Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other animals.
                        For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird. Occasionally, as the
                        mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs will roll out and settle on the
                        grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the goose will waddle over to the egg and
                        use its beak and neck to pull it back into the nest.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object, such as
                        a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the greater
                        their response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll a volleyball
                        back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the
                        greylag goose was following an instinctive rule: When I see a round object
                        nearby, I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I
                        should try to get it</p>
                    <p>It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for behavior,
                        and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule, it lights up like a
                        Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli.
                        A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with
                        three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger
                        response than usual.
                    </p>
                    <p>Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality. Junk food,
                        for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds
                        of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain
                        has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often
                        calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming
                        the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from,
                        eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.</p>
                    <p>Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but
                        your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt,
                        sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists
                        because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty
                        thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic
                        instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose.</p>
                    <p>A primary goal of food science is to create products that are more attractive to
                        consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some
                        way, if only with additional flavoring. Companies spend millions of dollars to
                        discover the most satisfying level of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect
                        amount of fizz in a soda. Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a
                        product feels in your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for
                        example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the outside,
                        light and smooth on the inside.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to items with a
                        combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy. Imagine the gooeyness of
                        melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust, or the crunch of an Oreo cookie
                        combined with its smooth center. With natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to
                        experience the same sensations over and over—how’s that seventeenth bite of
                        kale taste? After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel
                        full. But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel and
                        interesting, encouraging you to eat more.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss point” for
                        each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat that excites your
                        brain and keeps you coming back for more. The result, of course, is that you
                        overeat because hyperpalatable foods are more attractive to the human brain. As
                        Stephan Guyenet, a neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and
                        obesity, says, “We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”</p>
                    <p>The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just
                        one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more
                        attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
                    </p>
                    <p>Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of reality that
                        are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in. Stores feature
                        mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell clothes. Social media
                        delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes than we could ever get in the
                        office or at home. Online porn splices together stimulating scenes at a rate that
                        would be impossible to replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a
                        combination of ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—
                        even the model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the
                        supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features that are
                        naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result, driving us into
                        excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn habits, eating habits, and
                        many others.
                    </p>
                    <p>If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more
                        attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become more
                        concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more
                        concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a more
                        concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more concentrated
                        form of play than board games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed
                        experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but
                        temptations they never had to face.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to
                        make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn
                        how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every
                        habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do
                        this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.</p>
                    <p>We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—the
                        dopamine spike.</p>
                    <h4>THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP</h4>
                    <p>Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a
                        neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine became
                        apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an
                        experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire.
                        By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release
                        of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They
                        wouldn’t eat. They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few
                        days, the animals died of thirst.
                    </p>
                    <p>In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing
                        parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the
                        mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with
                        pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked,
                        they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The
                        ability to experience pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And
                        without desire, action stopped.
                    </p>
                    <p>When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system
                        of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one
                        study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose
                        in a box. Within minutes, the mice developed a craving so strong they began
                        poking their nose into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not so
                        different: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six hundred times
                        per hour.)</p>
                    <p>Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly
                        habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video games, browsing
                        social media—is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be
                        said for our most basic habitual behaviors like eating food, drinking water,
                        having sex, and interacting socially.
                    </p>
                    <p>For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we
                        know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including
                        motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary
                        movement.
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not
                        only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling
                        addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win.
                        Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after
                        they take it. Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your
                        levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does
                        your motivation to act.</p>
                    <p>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take
                        action.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive
                        a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This
                        is one reason the anticipation of an experience can often feel better than the
                        attainment of it. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than
                        opening the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be
                        more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this as the
                        difference between “wanting” and “liking.”</p>
                    <h4>THE DOPAMINE SPIKE</h4>
                    <p>Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than
                        for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the
                        nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the
                        amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking
                        centers of the brain are much smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot
                        spots” and are distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance,
                        researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is activated
                        during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure is activated during
                        liking.</p>
                    <p>The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions
                        responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role
                        these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is
                        taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to
                        the response.</p>
                    <p>These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change. We
                        need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding
                        experience that motivates us to act in the first place. This is where a strategy
                        known as temptation bundling comes into play.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS
                        MORE ATTRACTIVE
                    </h4>
                    <p>Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland, enjoyed
                        watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise more often than he
                        did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike and
                        connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote a computer program that
                        would allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed
                        down for too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started
                        pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, “eliminating obesity one Netflix
                        binge at a time.”</p>
                    <p>He was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise habit more
                        attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with
                        an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he bundled watching Netflix (the
                        thing he wanted to do) with riding his stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).
                        Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the
                        American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC, launched its
                        Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015 season, they promoted
                        temptation bundling on a massive scale.</p>
                    <p>Every Thursday, the company would air three shows created by screenwriter
                        Shonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away with Murder.
                        They branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s Thursday).
                        In addition to promoting the shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn,
                        drink red wine, and enjoy the evening.</p>
                    <p>Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind the
                        campaign: “We see Thursday night as a viewership opportunity, with either
                        couples or women by themselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun
                        and drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy
                        is that ABC was associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their
                        shows) with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and
                        eat popcorn).</p>
                    <p>Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed and
                        entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday,
                        then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means relaxation and entertainment. The
                        reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of turning on the television
                        becomes more attractive.
                    </p>
                    <p>You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your
                        favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the latest
                        celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you
                        could only read the tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym. Maybe you
                        want to get a pedicure, but you need to clean out your email inbox. Solution:
                        only get a pedicure while processing overdue work emails.</p>
                    <p>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as
                        Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the
                        principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable
                        behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue
                        work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do
                        something you really want to do along the way.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy
                        we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior.</p>
                    <h4>The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:</h4>
                    <p>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</p>
                    <p>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</p>
                    <p>If you want to read the news, but you need to express more gratitude:</p>
                    <p>After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful for
                        that happened yesterday (need).</p>
                    <p>After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).</p>
                    <p>If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:</p>
                    <p>After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential clients (need).</p>
                    <p>After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).</p>
                    <p>If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:</p>
                    <p>After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).</p>
                    <p>After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).</p>
                    <p>The hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three clients or
                        doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest sports news or
                        check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means you get to do the thing
                        you want to do.</p>
                    <p>
                        We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are
                        heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action. Temptation
                        bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any habit by connecting it
                        with something you already want. Engineering a truly irresistible habit is a hard
                        task, but this simple strategy can be employed to make nearly any habit more
                        attractive than it would be otherwise.

                    <p>The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become

                <h3>The role of family and friends in shaping your habits</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of strange letters to a
                        woman named Klara.</p>
                    <p>Laszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he believed in: he
                        completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He claimed that with deliberate
                        practice and the development of good habits, a child could become a genius in
                        any field. His mantra was “A genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”</p>
                    <p>Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with his own
                        children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a wife willing to
                        jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she may not have been as
                        adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with proper instruction, anyone could
                        advance their skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment, and he laid
                        out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies. The kids would be
                        home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The house would be filled with
                        chess books and pictures of famous chess players. The children would play
                        against each other constantly and compete in the best tournaments they could
                        find. The family would keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history
                        of every competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess.</p>
                    <p>Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the Polgars were
                        parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.</p>
                    <p>Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old. Within
                        six months, she was defeating adults.</p>
                    <p>Sofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world
                        champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.</p>
                    <p>Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat her father.
                        At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among the top one hundred
                        chess players in the world. At fifteen years and four months old, she became the
                        youngest grandmaster of all time—younger than Bobby Fischer, the previous
                        record holder. For twenty-seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female
                        chess player in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>The childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least. And yet, if
                        you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was attractive, even enjoyable. In
                        interviews, the sisters talk about their childhood as entertaining rather than
                        grueling. They loved playing chess. They couldn’t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo
                        reportedly found Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.
                        Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces alone!” To
                        which she replied, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!”</p>
                    <p>The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else—
                        praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess
                        was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever habits are normal in your
                        culture are among the most attractive behaviors you’ll find.
                    </p>
                    <h4>THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS</h4>
                    <p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the
                        respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival.
                        For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming
                        separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence. “The
                        lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased
                        safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted,
                        “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and
                        improvise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest
                        human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful
                        influence on our modern behavior.</p>
                    <p>We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script
                        handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local
                        community and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups comes with
                        its own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to get married,
                        how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much money to
                        spend on your child’s birthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the
                        invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them
                        in mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow the habits
                        of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without
                        remembering. As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The
                        customs and practices of life in society sweep us along.”</p>
                    <p>Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden.
                        Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that rewards you for your
                        chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do. If you
                        work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to
                        splurge on one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a
                        new phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors
                        are attractive when they help us fit in</p>
                    <p>We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:</p>
                    <p>The close.</p>
                    <p>The many</p>
                    <p>The powerful.</p>
                    <p>Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change
                        and make our habits more attractive.</p>
                    <p>Imitating the Close</p>
                    <p>Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the physical
                        environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true of the social
                        environment.</p>
                    <p>We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents
                        handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our
                        coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give it a try, too. When
                        your wife has a habit of double-checking that the door is locked before going to
                        bed, you pick it up as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without realizing it.
                        In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture of the other person.
                        In college, I began to talk like my roommates. When traveling to other countries,
                        I unconsciously imitate the local accent despite reminding myself to stop.</p>
                    <p>As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to
                        imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand
                        people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s chances of becoming
                        obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese.” It
                        works the other way, too. Another study found that if one person in a
                        relationship lost weight, the other partner would also slim down about one third
                        of the time. Our friends and family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that
                        pulls us in their direction.</p>
                    <p>Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad influences.
                        When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at MIT, he took a small
                        robotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four became astronauts. If your
                        goal was to make it into space, then that room was about the best culture you
                        could ask for. Similarly, one study found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at
                        age eleven or twelve, the higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after
                        controlling for natural levels of intelligence. We soak up the qualities and
                        practices of those around us.</p>
                    <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a
                        culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. New habits seem
                        achievable when you see others doing them every day. If you are surrounded by
                        fit people, you’re more likely to consider working out to be a common habit. If
                        you’re surrounded by jazz lovers, you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to
                        play jazz every day. Your culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.”
                        Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have yourself.
                        You’ll rise together.
                    </p>
                    <p>To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy one step
                        further.</p>
                    <p>Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2)
                        you already have something in common with the group. Steve Kamb, an
                        entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company called Nerd Fitness, which
                        “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose weight, get strong, and get healthy.” His
                        clients include video game lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to
                        get in shape. Many people feel out of place the first time they go to the gym or
                        try to change their diet, but if you are already similar to the other members of the
                        group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change becomes
                        more appealing because it feels like something people like you already do.</p>
                    <p>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a
                        personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on your own. Your
                        identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athlete.
                        When you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes
                        linked to those around you. Growth and change is no longer an individual
                        pursuit. We are readers. We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity
                        begins to reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group
                        after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s friendship and
                        community that embed a new identity and help behaviors last over the long run.</p>
                    <p>Imitating the Many</p>
                    <p>In the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of experiments that
                        are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. To begin each experiment,
                        the subject entered the room with a group of strangers. Unbeknownst to them,
                        the other participants were actors planted by the researcher and instructed to
                        deliver scripted answers to certain questions.
                        The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second card
                        with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on the second card
                        that was similar in length to the line on the first card. It was a very simple task.
                        Here is an example of two cards used in the experiment:</p>
                    <h4>CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS</h4>
                    <p>The experiment always began the same. First, there would be some easy trials
                        where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few rounds, the participants
                        were shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones, except the actors
                        in the room would select an intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they
                        would respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would
                        agree that the lines were the same even though they were clearly different.
                    </p>
                    <p>The subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately become
                        bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh nervously to
                        themselves. They would double-check the reactions of other participants. Their
                        agitation would grow as one person after another delivered the same incorrect
                        response. Soon, the subject began to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they
                        delivered the answer they knew in their heart to be incorrect.
                    </p>
                    <p>Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways. What he
                        discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the conformity of
                        the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor, then there was no effect on
                        the person’s choice. They just assumed they were in the room with a dummy.
                        When two actors were in the room with the subject, there was still little impact.
                        But as the number of people increased to three actors and four and all the way to
                        eight, the subject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end of
                        the experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the group
                        answer even though it was obviously incorrect.</p>
                    <p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our
                        behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is
                        everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor
                        because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s
                        usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.
                        But there can be a downside.</p>
                    <p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the
                        individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an
                        effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to
                        a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior
                        nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.
                    </p>
                    <p>Humans are similar. There is tremendous internal pressure to comply with the
                        norms of the group. The reward of being accepted is often greater than the
                        reward of winning an argument, looking smart, or finding truth. Most days, we’d
                        rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.</p>
                    <p>The human mind knows how to get along with others. It wants to get along
                        with others. This is our natural mode. You can override it—you can choose to
                        ignore the group or to stop caring what other people think—but it takes work.
                        Running against the grain of your culture requires extra effort.
                        When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is
                        unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change
                        is very attractive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Imitating the Powerful</p>
                    <p>Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We want pins and
                        medallions on our jackets. We want President or Partner in our titles. We want to
                        be acknowledged, recognized, and praised. This tendency can seem vain, but
                        overall, it’s a smart move. Historically, a person with greater power and status
                        has access to more resources, worries less about survival, and proves to be a
                        more attractive mate.</p>
                    <p>We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and
                        status. We want to be the one in the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician
                        who can play the hardest chord progressions or the parent with the most
                        accomplished children because these things separate us from the crowd. Once
                        we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out.</p>
                    <p>This is one reason we care so much about the habits of highly effective
                        people. We try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire
                        success ourselves. Many of our daily habits are imitations of people we admire.
                        You replicate the marketing strategies of the most successful firms in your
                        industry. You make a recipe from your favorite baker. You borrow the
                        storytelling strategies of your favorite writer. You mimic the communication
                        style of your boss. We imitate people we envy.</p>
                    <p>High-status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that
                        means if a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.
                        We are also motivated to avoid behaviors that would lower our status. We
                        trim our hedges and mow our lawn because we don’t want to be the slob of the
                        neighborhood. When our mother comes to visit, we clean up the house because
                        we don’t want to be judged. We are continually wondering “What will others
                        think of me?” and altering our behavior based on the answer.</p>
                    <p>The Polgar sisters—the chess prodigies mentioned at the beginning of this
                        chapter—are evidence of the powerful and lasting impact social influences can
                        have on our behavior. The sisters practiced chess for many hours each day and
                        continued this remarkable effort for decades. But these habits and behaviors
                        maintained their attractiveness, in part, because they were valued by their
                        culture. From the praise of their parents to the achievement of different status
                        markers like becoming a grandmaster, they had many reasons to continue their
                        effort.</p>
                    <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
                    <p>The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.</p>
                    <p>We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture
                        because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe</p>
                    <p>We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family
                        and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status
                        and prestige).
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to
                        join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior
                        and (2) you already have something in common with the group.</p>
                    <p>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired
                        behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the
                        crowd than be right by ourselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it
                        attractive.</p>

                <h3>How to find and fix the causes of your bad habits</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In late 2012, I was sitting in an old apartment just a few blocks from Istanbul’s most
                        famous street, Istiklal Caddesi. I was in the middle of a four-day trip to Turkey
                        and my guide, Mike, was relaxing in a worn-out armchair a few feet away.
                        Mike wasn’t really a guide. He was just a guy from Maine who had been
                        living in Turkey for five years, but he offered to show me around while I was
                        visiting the country and I took him up on it. On this particular night, I had been
                        invited to dinner with him and a handful of his Turkish friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>There were seven of us, and I was the only one who hadn’t, at some point,
                        smoked at least one pack of cigarettes per day. I asked one of the Turks how he
                        got started. “Friends,” he said. “It always starts with your friends. One friend
                        smokes, then you try it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>What was truly fascinating was that half of the people in the room had
                        managed to quit smoking. Mike had been smoke-free for a few years at that
                        point, and he swore up and down that he broke the habit because of a book
                        called Allen Carr’s Easy Way to Stop Smoking.</p>
                    <p>“It frees you from the mental burden of smoking,” he said. “It tells you: ‘Stop
                        lying to yourself. You know you don’t actually want to smoke. You know you
                        don’t really enjoy this.’ It helps you feel like you’re not the victim anymore. You
                        start to realize that you don’t need to smoke.”</p>
                    <p>I had never tried a cigarette, but I took a look at the book afterward out of
                        curiosity. The author employs an interesting strategy to help smokers eliminate
                        their cravings. He systematically reframes each cue associated with smoking and
                        gives it a new meaning.</p>
                    <p>He says things like:</p>
                    <p>You think you are quitting something, but you’re not quitting anything
                        because cigarettes do nothing for you.</p>
                    <p>You think smoking is something you need to do to be social, but it’s
                        not. You can be social without smoking at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>You think smoking is about relieving stress, but it’s not. Smoking does
                        not relieve your nerves, it destroys them.</p>
                    <p>Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it clearly
                        into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making
                        marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in
                        confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and
                        quality of your future life.”
                    </p>
                    <p>By the time you get to the end of the book, smoking seems like the most
                        ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect smoking to bring
                        you any benefits, you have no reason to smoke. It is an inversion of the 2nd Law
                        of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.</p>
                    <p>Now, I know this idea might sound overly simplistic. Just change your mind and
                        you can quit smoking. But stick with me for a minute.
                    </p>
                    <h4>WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM</h4>
                    <p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. I
                        often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to eat tacos.” If you
                        were to ask me why I want to eat tacos, I wouldn’t say, “Because I need food to
                        survive.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I am motivated to eat tacos
                        because I have to eat to survive. The underlying motive is to obtain food and
                        water even if my specific craving is for a taco.
                        Some of our underlying motives include:</p>´
                    <p>Conserve energy</p>
                    <p>Obtain food and water</p>
                    <p>Find love and reproduce</p>
                    <p>Connect and bond with others</p>
                    <p>Win social acceptance and approval</p>
                    <p>Reduce uncertainty</p>
                    <p>Achieve status and prestige</p>
                    <p>A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your
                        brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or to
                        play video games. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and
                        relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.
                    </p>
                    <p>Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming and you’ll see that it does not
                        create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of
                        human nature.
                    </p>
                    <p>Find love and reproduce = using Tinder
                    </p>
                    <p>Connect and bond with others = browsing Facebook
                    </p>
                    <p>Win social acceptance and approval = posting on Instagram</p>
                    <p>Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google
                    </p>
                    <p>Achieve status and prestige = playing video games</p>
                    <p>Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old
                        vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The
                        specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.</p>
                    <p>Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same
                        underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce stress by smoking a
                        cigarette. Another person learns to ease their anxiety by going for a run. Your
                        current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face;
                        they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with
                        the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it.</p>
                    <p>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we
                        predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of
                        the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in
                        the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation
                        and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.</p>
                    <p>Cue: You notice that the stove is hot.</p>
                    <p>Prediction: If I touch it I’ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.</p>
                    <p>Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green.</p>
                    <p>Prediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection and
                        get closer to my destination, so I should step on the gas.
                    </p>
                    <p>You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the
                        appropriate response.</p>
                    <p>This all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits because
                        every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually
                        predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given
                        what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are
                        endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another way, our
                        behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us,
                        not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves. Two people can
                        look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is
                        repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit
                        depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction
                        that precedes them.
                    </p>
                    <p>These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a
                        craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues
                        we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They
                        help explain what we are currently sensing. For instance, whether or not you
                        realize it, you are noticing how warm or cold you feel right now. If the
                        temperature drops by one degree, you probably won’t do anything. If the
                        temperature drops ten degrees, however, you’ll feel cold and put on another
                        layer of clothing. Feeling cold was the signal that prompted you to act. You have
                        been sensing the cues the entire time, but it is only when you predict that you
                        would be better off in a different state that you take action.</p>
                    <p>A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change
                        your internal state. When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your
                        body is currently sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your
                        current state and your desired state provides a reason to act.</p>
                    <p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be
                        in the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel
                        differently than you do in the moment. When you binge-eat or light up or browse
                        social media, what you really want is not a potato chip or a cigarette or a bunch
                        of likes. What you really want is to feel different.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our feelings and emotions tell us whether to hold steady in our current state or
                        to make a change. They help us decide the best course of action. Neurologists
                        have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose
                        the ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to
                        avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that
                        allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.”</p>
                    <p>
                        To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are
                        really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a
                        habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. In
                        time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or
                        that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive
                        when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our
                        advantage rather than to our detriment.
                    </p>
                    <h4>HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS</h4>
                    <p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with
                        a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For
                        instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have
                        to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your
                        business. You have to cook dinner for your family.</p>
                    <p>Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to.
                        You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for
                        your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one
                        word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these
                        behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those
                        things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set
                        we choose.</p>
                    <p>I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was
                        difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I
                        am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and
                        never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed
                        how he lived each day.</p>
                    <p>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is
                        a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more
                        attractive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that
                        drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to
                        develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself “I need to go run in
                        the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Finance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can
                        associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth:
                        living below your current means increases your future means. The money you
                        save this month increases your purchasing power next month.
                    </p>
                    <p>Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds
                        knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction inevitably pops into
                        your mind. You can transform frustration into delight when you realize that each
                        interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath. Distraction
                        is a good thing because you need distractions to practice meditation.

                    <p>Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big
                        presentation or competing in an important event. They experience quicker
                        breathing, a faster heart rate, heightened arousal. If we interpret these feelings
                        negatively, then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings
                        positively, then we can respond with fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I am
                        nervous” to “I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me
                        concentrate.”
                    </p>
                    <p>These little mind-set shifts aren’t magic, but they can help change the feelings
                        you associate with a particular habit or situation.</p>
                    <p>If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You
                        simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can
                        use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. For instance, if you always
                        play the same song before having sex, then you’ll begin to link the music with
                        the act. Whenever you want to get in the mood, just press play.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ed Latimore, a boxer and writer from Pittsburgh, benefited from a similar
                        strategy without knowing it. “Odd realization,” he wrote. “My focus and
                        concentration goes up just by putting my headphones [on] while writing. I don’t
                        even have to play any music.” Without realizing it, he was conditioning himself.
                        In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and
                        did focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones
                        on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The
                        craving followed naturally.
                    </p>
                    <p>Athletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to perform.
                        During my baseball career, I developed a specific ritual of stretching and
                        throwing before each game. The whole sequence took about ten minutes, and I
                        did it the same way every single time. While it physically warmed me up to play,
                        more importantly, it put me in the right mental state. I began to associate my
                        pregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even if I wasn’t motivated
                        beforehand, by the time I was done with my ritual, I was in “game mode.”
                    </p>
                    <p>You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel
                        happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting
                        your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you
                        perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep
                        breaths and smile.
                    </p>
                    <p>Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with being
                        in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established,
                        you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed
                        at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths
                        and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it
                        has little to do with the original situation</p>
                    <p>The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the
                        associations you have about them. It’s not easy, but if you can reprogram your
                        predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one.

                <h2>Make It Easy</h2>
                <h3>Walk slowly, but never backward</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>On the first day of class, Jerry Uelsmann, a professor at the University of Florida,
                        divided his film photography students into two groups.</p>
                    <p>Everyone on the left side of the classroom, he explained, would be in the
                        “quantity” group. They would be graded solely on the amount of work they
                        produced. On the final day of class, he would tally the number of photos
                        submitted by each student. One hundred photos would rate an A, ninety photos a
                        B, eighty photos a C, and so on.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, everyone on the right side of the room would be in the “quality”
                        group. They would be graded only on the excellence of their work. They would
                        only need to produce one photo during the semester, but to get an A, it had to be
                        a nearly perfect image.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were
                        produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy
                        taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various
                        methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of
                        creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality
                        group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show
                        for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.</p>
                    <p>It is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the
                        fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for
                        a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never
                        get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of
                        the good.”</p>
                    <p>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The
                        two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion,
                        you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but
                        they don’t produce a result.</p>
                    <p>Action, on the other hand, is the type of behavior that will deliver an outcome.
                        If I outline twenty ideas for articles I want to write, that’s motion. If I actually sit
                        down and write an article, that’s action. If I search for a better diet plan and read
                        a few books on the topic, that’s motion. If I actually eat a healthy meal, that’s
                        action.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It
                        doesn’t matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion
                        will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result
                        you’re looking to achieve.</p>
                    <p>If motion doesn’t lead to results, why do we do it? Sometimes we do it
                        because we actually need to plan or learn more. But more often than not, we do
                        it because motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running
                        the risk of failure. Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. It doesn’t feel
                        good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that
                        might happen. And that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than
                        taking action: you want to delay failure.
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s easy to be in motion and convince yourself that you’re still making
                        progress. You think, “I’ve got conversations going with four potential clients
                        right now. This is good. We’re moving in the right direction.” Or, “I
                        brainstormed some ideas for that book I want to write. This is coming together.”
                        Motion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just
                        preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of
                        procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be
                        planning. You want to be practicing.</p>
                    <p>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection.
                        You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to
                        practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your
                        reps in.</p>
                    <h4>HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?</h4>
                    <p>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more
                        automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the
                        structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.
                        Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening
                        of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity.
                        With each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections
                        tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this
                        phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together
                        wire together.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Repeating a habit leads to clear physical changes in the brain. In musicians,
                        the cerebellum—critical for physical movements like plucking a guitar string or
                        pulling a violin bow—is larger than it is in nonmusicians. Mathematicians,
                        meanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior parietal lobule, which
                        plays a key role in computation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated
                        with the amount of time spent in the field; the older and more experienced the
                        mathematician, the greater the increase in gray matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that
                        the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial memory—was
                        significantly larger in their subjects than in non–taxi drivers. Even more
                        fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver retired. Like the
                        muscles of the body responding to regular weight training, particular regions of
                        the brain adapt as they are used and atrophy as they are abandoned.
                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was recognized
                        long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the English
                        philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to
                        play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great
                        difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass
                        have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a
                        pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they
                        can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.” Both common sense
                        and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change.</p>
                    <p>Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit
                        associated with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of
                        the most critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. It is why the
                        students who took tons of photos improved their skills while those who merely
                        theorized about perfect photos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the
                        other in passive learning. One in action, the other in motion.</p>
                    <p>All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic
                        behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform
                        a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the
                        nonconscious mind takes over.</p>
                    <p>It looks something like this:
                    </p>
                    <h4>THE HABIT LINE</h4>
                    <p>On the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers track the
                        level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten minutes each day.
                        The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an
                        important truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not
                        time.</p>
                    <h4>WALKING 10 MINUTES PER DAY</h4>
                    <p>One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a
                        new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take
                        to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit
                        automatic?</p>
                    <p>There is nothing magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. It
                        doesn’t matter if it’s been twenty-one days or thirty days or three hundred days.
                        What matters is the rate at which you perform the behavior. You could do
                        something twice in thirty days, or two hundred times. It’s the frequency that
                        makes the difference. Your current habits have been internalized over the course
                        of hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level
                        of frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts until the
                        behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.</p>
                    <p>In practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to become
                        automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need to take to make
                        progress. Whether an action is fully automatic is of less importance.
                    </p>
                    <p>To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make
                        practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy.
                        The chapters that follow will show you how to do exactly that.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as
                        important as the number of times you have performed it.</p>

                <h3>The law of least effort</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In his award-winning book, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologist and biologist Jared
                        Diamond points out a simple fact: different continents have different shapes. At
                        first glance, this statement seems rather obvious and unimportant, but it turns out
                        to have a profound impact on human behavior.</p>
                    <p>The primary axis of the Americas runs from north to south. That is, the
                        landmass of North and South America tends to be tall and thin rather than wide
                        and fat. The same is generally true for Africa. Meanwhile, the landmass that
                        makes up Europe, Asia, and the Middle East is the opposite. This massive stretch
                        of land tends to be more east-west in shape. According to Diamond, this
                        difference in shape played a significant role in the spread of agriculture over the
                        centuries.</p>
                    <p>When agriculture began to spread around the globe, farmers had an easier
                        time expanding along east-west routes than along north-south ones. This is
                        because locations along the same latitude generally share similar climates,
                        amounts of sunlight and rainfall, and changes in season. These factors allowed
                        farmers in Europe and Asia to domesticate a few crops and grow them along the
                        entire stretch of land from France to China.</p>
                    <h4>THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR</h4>
                    <p>By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to south.
                        Just imagine how different the weather is in Florida compared to Canada. You
                        can be the most talented farmer in the world, but it won’t help you grow Florida
                        oranges in the Canadian winter. Snow is a poor substitute for soil. In order to
                        spread crops along north-south routes, farmers would need to find and
                        domesticate new plants whenever the climate changed.</p>
                    <p>As a result, agriculture spread two to three times faster across Asia and
                        Europe than it did up and down the Americas. Over the span of centuries, this
                        small difference had a very big impact. Increased food production allowed for
                        more rapid population growth. With more people, these cultures were able to
                        build stronger armies and were better equipped to develop new technologies.
                        The changes started out small—a crop that spread slightly farther, a population
                        that grew slightly faster—but compounded into substantial differences over time.</p>
                    <p>The spread of agriculture provides an example of the 3rd Law of Behavior
                        Change on a global scale. Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key
                        to habit change. Maybe if you really wanted it, you’d actually do it. But the truth
                        is, our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. And despite
                        what the latest productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a
                        dumb one.</p>
                    <p>Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It
                        is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when
                        deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the
                        option that requires the least amount of work.* For example, expanding your
                        farm to the east where you can grow the same crops rather than heading north
                        where the climate is different. Out of all the possible actions we could take, the
                        one that is realized is the one that delivers the most value for the least effort. We
                        are motivated to do what is easy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required,
                        the less likely it is to occur. If your goal is to do a hundred push-ups per day,
                        that’s a lot of energy! In the beginning, when you’re motivated and excited, you
                        can muster the strength to get started. But after a few days, such a massive effort
                        feels exhausting. Meanwhile, sticking to the habit of doing one push-up per day
                        requires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the
                        more likely it is to occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>Look at any behavior that fills up much of your life and you’ll see that it can
                        be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on our
                        phones, checking email, and watching television steal so much of our time
                        because they can be performed almost without effort. They are remarkably
                        convenient.</p>
                    <p>In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want.
                        Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm.
                        Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit
                        itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the
                        obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between
                        you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so
                        easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your
                        good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.
                        But what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite? If we’re all
                        so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard things like raising a
                        child or starting a business or climbing Mount Everest?</p>
                    <p>Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is that
                        some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel like giving
                        in. On the tough days, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor
                        as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your
                        way. The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge.
                        The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it
                        as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some water
                        can flow through, but not very much. If you want to increase the rate at which
                        water passes through the hose, you have two options. The first option is to crank
                        up the valve and force more water out. The second option is to simply remove
                        the bend in the hose and let water flow through naturally.
                    </p>
                    <p>Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like trying to
                        force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and
                        increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and
                        easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the
                        friction in your life, you reduce it.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your
                        habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment
                        design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize
                        your environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to
                        practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of
                        your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your
                        life. You are more likely to go to the gym if it is on your way to work because
                        stopping doesn’t add much friction to your lifestyle. By comparison, if the gym
                        is off the path of your normal commute—even by just a few blocks—now you’re
                        going “out of your way” to get there.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or
                        office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. We try to
                        follow a strict diet while we are out to dinner with friends. We try to write a
                        book in a chaotic household. We try to concentrate while using a smartphone
                        filled with distractions. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can remove the points
                        of friction that hold us back. This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in
                        Japan began to do in the 1970s</p>
                    <p>In an article published in the New Yorker titled “Better All the Time,” James
                        Suroweicki writes:
                    </p>
                    <p>“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean production,’
                        relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production process,
                        down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting
                        and turning to reach their tools. The result was that Japanese factories were more
                        efficient and Japanese products were more reliable than American ones. In 1974,
                        service calls for American-made color televisions were five times as common as
                        for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as long
                        to assemble their sets.”</p>
                    <p>I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction.* The Japanese
                        companies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process and
                        eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and
                        revenue. Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and
                        energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can
                        feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the
                        cognitive load our environment places on us.)</p>
                    <p>If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the
                        things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your
                        life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating
                        apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Ride-sharing services
                        reduce the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of
                        sending a letter in the mail.</p>
                    <p>Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to
                        reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate,
                        eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of
                        fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an
                        account. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask
                        their customers to make fewer choices.
                    </p>
                    <p>When the first voice-activated speakers were released—products like Google
                        Home, Amazon Echo, and Apple HomePod—I asked a friend what he liked
                        about the product he had purchased. He said it was just easier to say “Play some
                        country music” than to pull out his phone, open the music app, and pick a
                        playlist. Of course, just a few years earlier, having unlimited access to music in
                        your pocket was a remarkably frictionless behavior compared to driving to the
                        store and buying a CD. Business is a never-ending quest to deliver the same
                        result in an easier fashion.</p>
                    <p>Similar strategies have been used effectively by governments. When the
                        British government wanted to increase tax collection rates, they switched from
                        sending citizens to a web page where the tax form could be downloaded to
                        linking directly to the form. Reducing that one step in the process increased the
                        response rate from 19.2 percent to 23.4 percent. For a country like the United
                        Kingdom, those percentage points represent millions in tax revenue.</p>
                    <p>
                        The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as
                        easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to
                        finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase
                        the friction associated with our bad ones.
                    </p>
                    <h4>PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE</h4>
                    <p>Oswald Nuckols is an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi. He is also
                        someone who understands the power of priming his environment.</p>
                    <p>Nuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by following a strategy he refers to as
                        “resetting the room.” For instance, when he finishes watching television, he
                        places the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch, and
                        folds the blanket. When he leaves his car, he throws any trash away. Whenever
                        he takes a shower, he wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. (As
                        he notes, the “perfect time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself in
                        the shower anyway.”) The purpose of resetting each room is not simply to clean
                        up after the last action, but to prepare for the next action.</p>
                    <p>“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote.
                        “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape. . . .
                        People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just proactively lazy. It
                        gives you so much time back.”</p>
                    <p>Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to
                        make the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards
                        that are presorted by occasion—birthday, sympathy, wedding, graduation, and
                        more. Whenever necessary, she grabs an appropriate card and sends it off. She is
                        incredibly good at remembering to send cards because she has reduced the
                        friction of doing so. For years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a baby
                        and I would think, “I should send a card.” But then weeks would pass and by the
                        time I remembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The habit wasn’t
                        easy.</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for immediate
                        use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the
                        cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and utensils you’ll need the
                        night before. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy.

                    <p>Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing
                        tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.</p>
                    <p>Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and
                        water bottle ahead of time.</p>
                    <p>Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on
                        weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to
                        healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.</p>
                    <p>These are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least resistance.
                        You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make bad
                        behaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too much television, for
                        example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out
                        loud the name of the show you want to watch. This setup creates just enough
                        friction to prevent mindless viewing.</p>
                    <p>If that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug the television and
                        take the batteries out of the remote after each use, so it takes an extra ten seconds
                        to turn it back on. And if you’re really hard-core, move the television out of the
                        living room and into a closet after each use. You can be sure you’ll only take it
                        out when you really want to watch something. The greater the friction, the less
                        likely the habit.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until lunch. When
                        it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason at all. But when it is
                        in another room, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high enough that I
                        won’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I get three to four hours each
                        morning when I can work without interruption.</p>
                    <p>If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell a friend
                        or family member to hide it from you for a few hours. Ask a coworker to keep it
                        at their desk in the morning and give it back to you at lunch.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behavior.
                        When I hide beer in the back of the fridge where I can’t see it, I drink less. When
                        I delete social media apps from my phone, it can be weeks before I download
                        them again and log in. These tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for
                        many of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a
                        good habit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making
                        dozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to make the good
                        behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.</p>
                    <p>Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a
                        coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: “How can we
                        design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” Redesign your life so the
                        actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to do.</p>
                    <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
                    <p>Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally
                        gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.</p>
                    <p>Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as
                        possible.</p>
                    <p>Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is
                        low, habits are easy.</p>
                    <p>Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is
                        high, habits are difficult.

                <h3>How to stop procastinating by using the two-minute rule</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Twyla Tharp is widely regarded as one of the greatest dancers and choreographers
                        of the modern era. In 1992, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, often
                        referred to as the Genius Grant, and she has spent the bulk of her career touring
                        the globe to perform her original works. She also credits much of her success to
                        simple daily habits.</p>
                    <p>“I begin each day of my life with a ritual,” she writes. “I wake up at 5:30
                        A.M., put on my workout clothes, my leg warmers, my sweat shirt, and my hat. I
                        walk outside my Manhattan home, hail a taxi, and tell the driver to take me to
                        the Pumping Iron gym at 91st Street and First Avenue, where I work out for two
                        hours.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The ritual is not the stretching and weight training I put my body through
                        each morning at the gym; the ritual is the cab. The moment I tell the driver
                        where to go I have completed the ritual.</p>
                    <p>“It’s a simple act, but doing it the same way each morning habitualizes it—
                        makes it repeatable, easy to do. It reduces the chance that I would skip it or do it
                        differently. It is one more item in my arsenal of routines, and one less thing to
                        think about.”</p>
                    <p>Hailing a cab each morning may be a tiny action, but it is a splendid example
                        of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.</p>
                    <p>Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are
                        done out of habit. This is already a substantial percentage, but the true influence
                        of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic
                        choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be
                        completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take
                        for minutes or hours afterward.</p>
                    <p>Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path
                        and, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to
                        be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something
                        different. You sit through a bad movie for two hours. You keep snacking even
                        when you’re already full. You check your phone for “just a second” and soon
                        you have spent twenty minutes staring at the screen. In this way, the habits you
                        follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are
                        thinking.</p>
                    <p>Each evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that shapes
                        the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work and either we change
                        into our workout clothes and head to the gym or we crash onto the couch, order
                        Indian food, and watch The Office.* Similar to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab, the
                        ritual is changing into my workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the
                        workout will happen. Everything that follows—driving to the gym, deciding
                        which exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first
                        step.</p>
                    <p>Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I
                        refer to these little choices as decisive moments. The moment you decide
                        between ordering takeout or cooking dinner. The moment you choose between
                        driving your car or riding your bike. The moment you decide between starting
                        your homework or grabbing the video game controller. These choices are a fork
                        in the road.</p>
                    <h4>DECISIVE MOMENTS</h4>
                    <p>Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. For instance,
                        walking into a restaurant is a decisive moment because it determines what you’ll
                        be eating for lunch. Technically, you are in control of what you order, but in a
                        larger sense, you can only order an item if it is on the menu. If you walk into a
                        steakhouse, you can get a sirloin or a rib eye, but not sushi. Your options are
                        constrained by what’s available. They are shaped by the first choice.
                    </p>
                    <p>We are limited by where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the
                        decisive moments throughout your day is so important. Each day is made up of
                        many moments, but it is really a few habitual choices that determine the path
                        you take. These little choices stack up, each one setting the trajectory for how
                        you spend the next chunk of time.</p>
                    <p>Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They are the cab, not the gym.</p>
                    <h4>THE TWO-MINUTE RULE</h4>
                    <p>Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When you
                        dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up
                        trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this
                        tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new
                        habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”</p>
                    <p>You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute
                        version:</p>
                    <p>“Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”</p>
                    <p>“Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”</p>
                    <p>“Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”</p>
                    <p>“Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”</p>
                    <p>“Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”</p>
                    <p>The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can
                        meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And,
                        as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started
                        doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should
                        not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first
                        two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally
                        leads you down a more productive path.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired
                        outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.”
                        For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking
                        ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And
                        putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a
                        marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how
                        you follow the Two-Minute Rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or
                        meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one
                        thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must
                        be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of
                        showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of
                        trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more
                        consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.
                    </p>
                    <p>As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a
                        ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make
                        habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you
                        ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip
                        into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same
                        warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak
                        performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get
                        into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent power-down habit,
                        you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night. You may not be
                        able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless.
                        Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.</p>
                    <p>The Two-Minute Rule can seem like a trick to some people. You know that
                        the real goal is to do more than just two minutes, so it may feel like you’re
                        trying to fool yourself. Nobody is actually aspiring to read one page or do one
                        push-up or open their notes. And if you know it’s a mental trick, why would you
                        fall for it?</p>
                    <p>If the Two-Minute Rule feels forced, try this: do it for two minutes and then
                        stop. Go for a run, but you must stop after two minutes. Start meditating, but you
                        must stop after two minutes. Study Arabic, but you must stop after two minutes.
                        It’s not a strategy for starting, it’s the whole thing. Your habit can only last one
                        hundred and twenty seconds.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In the
                        beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he wasn’t allowed
                        to stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for five
                        minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. After a few weeks, he looked
                        around and thought, “Well, I’m always coming here anyway. I might as well
                        start staying a little longer.” A few years later, the weight was gone.
                    </p>
                    <p>Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from
                        getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give up
                        after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore.* The
                        secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg
                        McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily
                        journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped
                        journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar
                        advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are
                        going good,” he said.
                    </p>
                    <p>Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity
                        you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just
                        for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not
                        worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person
                        who doesn’t miss workouts. You’re taking the smallest action that confirms the
                        type of person you want to be.</p>
                    <p>We rarely think about change this way because everyone is consumed by the
                        end goal. But one push-up is better than not exercising. One minute of guitar
                        practice is better than none at all. One minute of reading is better than never
                        picking up a book. It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all.</p>
                    <p>At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each
                        day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit
                        shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by
                        mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then,
                        advance to an intermediate step and repeat the process—focusing on just the first
                        two minutes and mastering that stage before moving on to the next level.
                        Eventually, you’ll end up with the habit you had originally hoped to build while
                        still keeping your focus where it should be: on the first two minutes of the
                        behavior.

                    <p>Phase 3: Stop eating animals with two legs (chicken, turkey, etc.)</p>
                    <p>Phase 4: Stop eating animals with no legs (fish, clams, scallops, etc.).
                    </p>
                    <p>Phase 5: Stop eating all animal products (eggs, milk, cheese).</p>
                    <h5>Starting to Exercise</h5>
                    <p>Phase 1: Change into workout clothes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Phase 2: Step out the door (try taking a walk).</p>
                    <p>Phase 3: Drive to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave</p>
                    <p>Phase 4: Exercise for fifteen minutes at least once per week.</p>
                    <p>Phase 5: Exercise three times per week</p>
                    <p>Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior. I
                        want to live a healthy and long life > I need to stay in shape > I need to exercise
                        > I need to change into my workout clothes. I want to have a happy marriage > I
                        need to be a good partner > I should do something each day to make my
                        partner’s life easier > I should meal plan for next week.</p>
                    <p>Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ the TwoMinute Rule. It’s a
                        simple way to make your habits easy.</p>
                    <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
                    <p>Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your
                        behavior for minutes or hours afterward.</p>
                    <p>Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in
                        the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or
                        an unproductive one.</p>
                    <p>The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should
                        take less than two minutes to do.”
                    </p>
                    <p>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it
                        becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required
                        to do great things.
                    </p>
                    <p>Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that
                        doesn’t exist.</p>

                <h3>How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In the summer of 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months
                        earlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of
                        writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and
                        delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline
                        less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.
                        Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of
                        his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left
                        with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go
                        outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter
                        of 1830. The Hunchback of Notre Dame was published two weeks early on
                        January 14, 1831.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about
                        making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change:
                        make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on
                        your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad
                        habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device.
                        A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your
                        actions in the future. It is a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good
                        habits, and restrict you from bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away
                        so he could focus on writing, he was creating a commitment device.</p>
                    <p>There are many ways to create a commitment device. You can reduce
                        overeating by purchasing food in individual packages rather than in bulk size.
                        You can voluntarily ask to be added to the banned list at casinos and online
                        poker sites to prevent future gambling sprees. I’ve even heard of athletes who
                        have to “make weight” for a competition choosing to leave their wallets at home
                        during the week before weigh-in so they won’t be tempted to buy fast food.</p>
                    <p>As another example, my friend and fellow habits expert Nir Eyal purchased an
                        outlet timer, which is an adapter that he plugged in between his internet router
                        and the power outlet. At 10 p.m. each night, the outlet timer cuts off the power to
                        the router. When the internet goes off, everyone knows it is time to go to bed.</p>
                    <p>Commitment devices are useful because they enable you to take advantage of
                        good intentions before you can fall victim to temptation. Whenever I’m looking
                        to cut calories, for example, I will ask the waiter to split my meal and box half of
                        it to go before the meal is served. If I waited until the meal came out and told
                        myself “I’ll just eat half,” it would never work.</p>
                    <p>The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the
                        good habit than to get started on it. If you’re feeling motivated to get in shape,
                        schedule a yoga session and pay ahead of time. If you’re excited about the
                        business you want to start, email an entrepreneur you respect and set up a
                        consulting call. When the time comes to act, the only way to bail is to cancel the
                        meeting, which requires effort and may cost money.</p>
                    <p>Commitment devices increase the odds that you’ll do the right thing in the
                        future by making bad habits difficult in the present. However, we can do even
                        better. We can make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT
                        AGAIN</h4>
                    <p>John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his childhood
                        doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After
                        attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small
                        supply store for coal miners.
                    </p>
                    <p>It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and
                        enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That
                        was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him</p>
                    <p>In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept
                        in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video
                        cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you
                        were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to
                        manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.
                    </p>
                    <p>As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement
                        for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. Designed by fellow
                        Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine
                        automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction.
                        Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.</p>
                    <p>Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months,
                        Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the
                        equivalent of more than $100,000 today.</p>
                    <p>Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed businesses. He
                        bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the National Cash Register
                        Company. Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one thousand
                        employees and was on its way to becoming one of the most successful
                        businesses of its time.</p>
                    <p>The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the
                        friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash
                        register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically
                        impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred
                        behavior automatic.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and again. These
                        onetime choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value
                        over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver returns
                        again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite onetime actions that
                        lead to better long-term habits. The table on the following page shares some of
                        the most popular answers.</p>
                    <p>I’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the onetime
                        actions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to their habits—
                        most would find themselves living a better life a year from now. These onetime
                        actions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.
                        They make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, be productive, save money, and
                        generally live better.</p>
                    <h4>ONETIME ACTIONS THAT LOCK IN GOOD HABITS</h4>
                    <h5>Nutrition</h5>
                    <p>Buy a water filter to clean your drinking water.</p>
                    <p>Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake.</p>
                    <h5>Sleep</h5>
                    <p>Buy a good mattress.</p>
                    <p>Get blackout curtains.</p>
                    <p>Remove your television from your bedroom.</p>
                    <h5>Productivity</h5>
                    <p>Unsubscribe from emails</p>
                    <p>Turn off notifications and mute group chats.</p>
                    <p>Set your phone to silent.</p>
                    <p>Use email filters to clear up your inbox.</p>
                    <p>Delete games and social media apps on your phone.</p>
                    <h5>Happiness</h5>
                    <p>Get a dog</p>
                    <p>Move to a friendly, social neighborhood.</p>
                    <h5>General Health</h5>
                    <p>Get vaccinated</p>
                    <p>Buy good shoes to avoid back pain.</p>
                    <p>Buy a supportive chair or standing desk.</p>
                    <h5>Finance</h5>
                    <p>Enroll in an automatic savings plan.</p>
                    <p>Set up automatic bill pay.</p>
                    <p>Cut cable service.</p>
                    <p>Ask service providers to lower your bills.</p>
                    <p>Of course, there are many ways to automate good habits and eliminate bad
                        ones. Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you. Technology
                        can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into
                        behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective
                        way to guarantee the right behavior.</p>
                    <p>This is particularly useful for behaviors that happen too infrequently to
                        become habitual. Things you have to do monthly or yearly—like rebalancing
                        your investment portfolio—are never repeated frequently enough to become a
                        habit, so they benefit in particular from technology “remembering” to do them
                        for you.
                    </p>
                    <p>Other examples include:
                    </p>
                    <p>Medicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled.</p>
                    <p>Personal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an automatic
                        wage deduction.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping.
                    </p>
                    <p>Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website
                        blocker.
                    </p>
                    <p>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your
                        effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the
                        authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of
                        growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote,
                        “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform
                        without thinking about them.”</p>
                    <p>Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well. Bingewatching becomes a habit
                        because you have to put more effort in to stop looking
                        at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button to advance to
                        the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you. All you have to do
                        is keep your eyes open.</p>
                    <p>Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your
                        smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have
                        food delivered to your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in
                        the vast expanse of social media. When the effort required to act on your desires
                        becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse
                        arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves
                        jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but
                        ultimately more rewarding, work.
                    </p>
                    <p>I often find myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime. If I
                        feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write
                        off these minor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they can
                        accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug of “just one more minute” can
                        prevent me from doing anything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The
                        average person spends over two hours per day on social media. What could you
                        do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)</p>
                    <p>During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time
                        management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the passwords on
                        all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I
                        worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I
                        had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday
                        morning when she would do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up
                        with a friend or family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)</p>
                    <p>One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the first week
                        of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it
                        nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had
                        simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad habit became
                        impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more
                        meaningful tasks. After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it
                        became much easier to eat the healthy stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>When working in your favor, automation can make your good habits
                        inevitable and your bad habits impossible. It is the ultimate way to lock in future
                        behavior rather than relying on willpower in the moment. By utilizing
                        commitment devices, strategic onetime decisions, and technology, you can
                        create an environment of inevitability—a space where good habits are not just an
                        outcome you hope for but an outcome that is virtually guaranteed.</p>

                <h2>Make It Satisfying</h2>
                <h3>The cardinal rule of behavior change</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In the late 1990s, a public health worker named Stephen Luby left his hometown of
                        Omaha, Nebraska, and bought a one-way ticket to Karachi, Pakistan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Karachi was one of the most populous cities in the world. By 1998, over nine
                        million people called it home. It was the economic center of Pakistan and a
                        transportation hub, with some of the most active airports and seaports in the
                        region. In the commercial parts of town, you could find all of the standard urban
                        amenities and bustling downtown streets. But Karachi was also one of the least
                        livable cities in the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over 60 percent of Karachi’s residents lived in squatter settlements and slums.
                        These densely packed neighborhoods were filled with makeshift houses cobbled
                        together from old boards, cinder blocks, and other discarded materials. There
                        was no waste removal system, no electricity grid, no clean water supply. When
                        dry, the streets were a combination of dust and trash. When wet, they became a
                        muddy pit of sewage. Mosquito colonies thrived in pools of stagnant water, and
                        children played among the garbage.</p>
                    <p>The unsanitary conditions lead to widespread illness and disease.
                        Contaminated water sources caused epidemics of diarrhea, vomiting, and
                        abdominal pain. Nearly one third of the children living there were malnourished.
                        With so many people crammed into such a small space, viruses and bacterial
                        infections spread rapidly. It was this public health crisis that had brought
                        Stephen Luby to Pakistan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Luby and his team realized that in an environment with poor sanitation, the
                        simple habit of washing your hands could make a real difference in the health of
                        the residents. But they soon discovered that many people were already aware
                        that handwashing was important.</p>
                    <p>And yet, despite this knowledge, many residents were washing their hands in
                        a haphazard fashion. Some people would just run their hands under the water
                        quickly. Others would only wash one hand. Many would simply forget to wash
                        their hands before preparing food. Everyone said handwashing was important,
                        but few people made a habit out of it. The problem wasn’t knowledge. The
                        problem was consistency.</p>
                    <p>That was when Luby and his team partnered with Procter & Gamble to supply
                        the neighborhood with Safeguard soap. Compared to your standard bar of soap,
                        using Safeguard was a more enjoyable experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>“In Pakistan, Safeguard was a premium soap,” Luby told me. “The study
                        participants commonly mentioned how much they liked it.” The soap foamed
                        easily, and people were able to lather their hands with suds. It smelled great.
                        Instantly, handwashing became slightly more pleasurable.</p>
                    <p>“I see the goal of handwashing promotion not as behavior change but as habit
                        adoption,” Luby said. “It is a lot easier for people to adopt a product that
                        provides a strong positive sensory signal, for example the mint taste of
                        toothpaste, than it is to adopt a habit that does not provide pleasurable sensory
                        feedback, like flossing one’s teeth. The marketing team at Procter & Gamble
                        talked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience.”</p>
                    <p>Within months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children in
                        the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48
                        percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.
                    </p>
                    <p>The long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of the
                        households in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “Over 95 percent of
                        households who had been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash their
                        hands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when our study
                        team visited. . . . We had not given any soap to the intervention group for over
                        five years, but during the trial they had become so habituated to wash their
                        hands, that they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the
                        fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying</p>
                    <p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying.
                        This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing
                        your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the
                        brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain
                        that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.</p>
                    <p>Take the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold commercially
                        throughout the 1800s, but it wasn’t until Wrigley launched in 1891 that it
                        became a worldwide habit. Early versions were made from relatively bland
                        resins—chewy, but not tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the industry by adding
                        flavors like Spearmint and Juicy Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun
                        to use. Then they went a step further and began pushing chewing gum as a
                        pathway to a clean mouth. Advertisements told readers to “Refresh Your Taste.”
                        Tasty flavors and the feeling of a fresh mouth provided little bits of immediate
                        reinforcement and made the product satisfying to use. Consumption skyrocketed,
                        and Wrigley became the largest chewing gum company in the world.</p>
                    <p>Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success
                        when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their
                        products. These flavors don’t improve the effectiveness of toothpaste. They
                        simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of brushing your
                        teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she
                        didn’t like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor,
                        which proved to be more satisfying.</p>
                    <p>Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat
                        it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic
                        relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this
                        egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around.
                        Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so
                        uninteresting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What
                        is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in
                        the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in
                        the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive,
                        and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.
                        The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that
                        a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.
                    </p>
                    <p>But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We
                        are looking for immediate satisfaction.</p>
                    <h4>THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REWARDS</h4>
                    <p>Imagine you’re an animal roaming the plains of Africa—a giraffe or an elephant
                        or a lion. On any given day, most of your decisions have an immediate impact.
                        You are always thinking about what to eat or where to sleep or how to avoid a
                        predator. You are constantly focused on the present or the very near future. You
                        live in what scientists call an immediate-return environment because your
                        actions instantly deliver clear and immediate outcomes.</p>
                    <p>Now switch back to your human self. In modern society, many of the choices
                        you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do a good job at work,
                        you’ll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today, perhaps you won’t
                        be overweight next year. If you save money now, maybe you’ll have enough for
                        retirement decades from now. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return
                        environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the
                        intended payoff.
                    </p>
                    <p>The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The
                        earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are
                        approximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first humans to
                        have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest
                        part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—
                        was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are
                        walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.</p>
                    <p>It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has
                        shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment.* Compared to the age of
                        the brain, modern society is brand-new. In the last one hundred years, we have
                        seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the
                        internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in recent
                        years, but human nature has changed little.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent their
                        days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking shelter from
                        a storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification. The distant
                        future was less of a concern. And after thousands of generations in an
                        immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to
                        long-term ones.
                    </p>
                    <p>Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is,
                        the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* You value the
                        present more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward
                        that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible
                        in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer?
                        Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity?
                        Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually
                        transmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the
                        answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the
                        rewards are immediate. Smoking might kill you in ten years, but it reduces stress
                        and eases your nicotine cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the long run but
                        appetizing in the moment. Sex—safe or not—provides pleasure right away.
                        Disease and infection won’t show up for days or weeks, even years.
                    </p>
                    <p>Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these
                        outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome
                        usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the
                        reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels
                        good. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly
                        when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence
                        is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the
                        sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”</p>
                    <p>Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of
                        your bad habits are in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on
                        good intentions. When you make a plan—to lose weight, write a book, or learn a
                        language—you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you
                        envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in taking
                        actions with long-term benefits. We all want better lives for our future selves.
                        However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification usually
                        wins. You are no longer making a choice for Future You, who dreams of being
                        fitter or wealthier or happier. You are choosing for Present You, who wants to be
                        full, pampered, and entertained. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure
                        you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns
                        with your long-term goals.</p>
                    <p>With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some behaviors
                        and avoid others, let’s update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is
                        immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.</p>
                    <p>Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about
                        success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing
                        quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed
                        gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less
                        competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is
                        always the least crowded.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at delaying
                        gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower
                        likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills. We’ve
                        all seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching television and get
                        your homework done, you’ll generally learn more and get better grades. If you
                        don’t buy desserts and chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when
                        you get home. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore
                        an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.</p>
                    <p>Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise
                        approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at
                        peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment.
                        Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to
                        work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to
                        add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run
                        and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE</h4>
                    <p>The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it’s in a
                        small way. The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the
                        work was worth the effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real
                        world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you
                        with something. Early on, it’s all sacrifice. You’ve gone to the gym a few times,
                        but you’re not stronger or fitter or faster—at least, not in any noticeable sense.
                        It’s only months later, once you shed a few pounds or your arms gain some
                        definition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own sake. In the beginning,
                        you need a reason to stay on track. This is why immediate rewards are essential.
                        They keep you excited while the delayed rewards accumulate in the background.
                    </p>
                    <p>What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate
                        rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital
                        because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of
                        your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which
                        refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a
                        behavior. Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an
                        immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your
                        habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish.</p>
                    <p>Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits
                        of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging
                        to stick with habits like “no frivolous purchases” or “no alcohol this month”
                        because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair
                        of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place.
                        All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about
                        that.
                    </p>
                    <p>One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance
                        visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe
                        “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of
                        money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. Pass on another
                        month of Netflix? Move $10 over. It’s like creating a loyalty program for
                        yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward the
                        leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying
                        to do nothing.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to stop
                        eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled their savings
                        account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they
                        transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they put the money
                        toward the vacation.</p>
                    <p>It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that
                        reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying a new jacket
                        is fine if you’re trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn’t work if
                        you’re trying to budget and save money. Instead, taking a bubble bath or going
                        on a leisurely walk are good examples of rewarding yourself with free time,
                        which aligns with your ultimate goal of more freedom and financial
                        independence. Similarly, if your reward for exercising is eating a bowl of ice
                        cream, then you’re casting votes for conflicting identities, and it ends up being a
                        wash. Instead, maybe your reward is a massage, which is both a luxury and a
                        vote toward taking care of your body. Now the short-term reward is aligned with
                        your long-term vision of being a healthy person.</p>
                    <p>Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced
                        stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward.
                        The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are
                        and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less
                        you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit.
                        Identity sustains a habit.</p>
                    <p>That said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new identity to
                        emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term
                        while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.
                    </p>
                    <p>In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of
                        reinforcement—like soap that smells great or toothpaste that has a refreshing
                        mint flavor or seeing $50 hit your savings account—can offer the immediate
                        pleasure you need to enjoy a habit. And change is easy when it is enjoyable.</p>

                <h3>How to stick with good habits every day</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In 1993, a bank in Abbotsford, Canada, hired a twenty-three-year-old stockbroker
                        named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in
                        the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were
                        being made. Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody
                        expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily
                        habit.
                    </p>
                    <p>Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with
                        120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he
                        would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from
                        the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I
                        would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone
                        until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.</p>
                    <p>Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the firm. By
                        age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of $125,000
                        today. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with another company.</p>
                    <p>I like to refer to this technique as the Paper Clip Strategy and, over the years,
                        I’ve heard from readers who have employed it in a variety of ways. One woman
                        shifted a hairpin from one container to another whenever she wrote a page of her
                        book. Another man moved a marble from one bin to the next after each set of
                        push-ups.
                    </p>
                    <p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips
                        or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result,
                        they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any
                        activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs,
                        loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page
                        numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a
                        habit tracker.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK</h4>
                    <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. The most
                        basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your
                        routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each
                        of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your
                        habit streak</p>
                    <p>Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous was
                        Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried a small booklet
                        everywhere he went and used it to track thirteen personal virtues. This list
                        included goals like “Lose no time. Be always employed in something useful”
                        and “Avoid trifling conversation.” At the end of each day, Franklin would open
                        his booklet and record his progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing
                        jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to
                        “never break the chain” of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not
                        focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is
                        simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. Don’t break the chain of sales
                        calls and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of
                        workouts and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. Don’t break the chain of
                        creating every day and you will end up with an impressive portfolio. Habit
                        tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It
                        simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let’s break down each one</p>
                    <p>Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.</p>
                    <p>Recording your last action creates a trigger that can initiate your next one. Habit
                        tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your
                        calendar or the list of meals in your food log. When you look at the calendar and
                        see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people
                        who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and
                        lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t.
                        One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a
                        daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The mere act of
                        tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it.</p>
                    <p>Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our
                        own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way
                        to overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going
                        on each day. One glance at the paper clips in the container and you immediately
                        know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence
                        is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.
                    </p>
                    <p>Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.
                    </p>
                    <p>The most effective form of motivation is progress. When we get a signal that we
                        are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path. In
                        this way, habit tracking can have an addictive effect on motivation. Each small
                        win feeds your desire.
                    </p>
                    <p>This can be particularly powerful on a bad day. When you’re feeling down,
                        it’s easy to forget about all the progress you have already made. Habit tracking
                        provides visual proof of your hard work—a subtle reminder of how far you’ve
                        come. Plus, the empty square you see each morning can motivate you to get
                        started because you don’t want to lose your progress by breaking the streak</p>
                    <p>Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of
                        reward. It is satisfying to cross an item off your to-do list, to complete an entry
                        in your workout log, or to mark an X on the calendar. It feels good to watch your
                        results grow—the size of your investment portfolio, the length of your book
                        manuscript—and if it feels good, then you’re more likely to endure.</p>
                    <p>Habit tracking also helps keep your eye on the ball: you’re focused on the
                        process rather than the result. You’re not fixated on getting six-pack abs, you’re
                        just trying to keep the streak alive and become the type of person who doesn’t
                        miss workouts.
                    </p>
                    <p>In summary, habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act,
                        (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and
                        don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another
                        successful instance of your habit. Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual
                        proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become,
                        which is a delightful form of immediate and intrinsic gratification.*</p>
                    <p>You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I waited so
                        long to talk about it?</p>
                    <p>Despite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a simple reason:
                        many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel like a burden
                        because it forces you into two habits: the habit you’re trying to build and the
                        habit of tracking it. Counting calories sounds like a hassle when you’re already
                        struggling to follow a diet. Writing down every sales call seems tedious when
                        you’ve got work to do. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just eat less.” Or, “I’ll try
                        harder.” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” People inevitably tell me things like, “I
                        have a decision journal, but I wish I used it more.” Or, “I recorded my workouts
                        for a week, but then quit.” I’ve been there myself. I once made a food log to
                        track my calories. I managed to do it for one meal and then gave up.</p>
                    <p>Tracking isn’t for everyone, and there is no need to measure your entire life.
                        But nearly anyone can benefit from it in some form—even if it’s only temporary.
                        What can we do to make tracking easier?</p>
                    <p>First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. You’ll probably
                        be surprised by how much you’re already tracking without knowing it. Your
                        credit card statement tracks how often you go out to eat. Your Fitbit registers
                        how many steps you take and how long you sleep. Your calendar records how
                        many new places you travel to each year. Once you know where to get the data,
                        add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more
                        practical than tracking it every day.</p>
                    <p>Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is
                        better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The
                        completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you
                        to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit
                        tracking.
                    </p>
                    <h4>The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is:</h4>
                    <h4>After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT].</h4>
                    <p>After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip
                        over.
                    </p>
                    <p>After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout
                        journal.</p>
                    <p>After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate.
                    </p>
                    <p>These tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you aren’t the type
                        of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think you’ll find a few weeks of
                        measurements to be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how you’ve actually
                        been spending your time.
                    </p>
                    <p>That said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important than
                        any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits slide off
                        track.
                    </p>
                    <h4>HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK DOWN</h4>
                    <p>No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will
                        interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an
                        emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your
                        family needs a little more of your time.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: never
                        miss twice.</p>
                    <p>If I miss one day, I try to get back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one
                        workout happens, but I’m not going to miss two in a row. Maybe I’ll eat an
                        entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can
                        avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one.</p>
                    <p>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated
                        mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a
                        new habit.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have
                        a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful
                        people fail, they rebound quickly. The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the
                        reclaiming of it is fast.
                    </p>
                    <p>I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a
                        habit as well or as completely as I would like. Too often, we fall into an all-ornothing cycle
                        with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is
                        thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all.</p>
                    <p>You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy)
                        days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. If you start with
                        $100, then a 50 percent gain will take you to $150. But you only need a 33
                        percent loss to take you back to $100. In other words, avoiding a 33 percent loss
                        is just as valuable as achieving a 50 percent gain. As Charlie Munger says, “The
                        first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.”
                    </p>
                    <p>This is why the “bad” workouts are often the most important ones. Sluggish
                        days and bad workouts maintain the compound gains you accrued from previous
                        good days. Simply doing something—ten squats, five sprints, a push-up,
                        anything really—is huge. Don’t put up a zero. Don’t let losses eat into your
                        compounding.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, it’s not always about what happens during the workout. It’s
                        about being the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts. It’s easy to train
                        when you feel good, but it’s crucial to show up when you don’t feel like it—
                        even if you do less than you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not
                        improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity.</p>
                    <p>The all-or-nothing cycle of behavior change is just one pitfall that can derail
                        your habits. Another potential danger—especially if you are using a habit tracker
                        —is measuring the wrong thing.</p>
                    <h4>KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT</h4>
                    <p>Say you’re running a restaurant and you want to know if your chef is doing a
                        good job. One way to measure success is to track how many customers pay for a
                        meal each day. If more customers come in, the food must be good. If fewer
                        customers come in, something must be wrong.</p>
                    <p>However, this one measurement—daily revenue—only gives a limited picture
                        of what’s really going on. Just because someone pays for a meal doesn’t mean
                        they enjoy the meal. Even dissatisfied customers are unlikely to dine and dash.
                        In fact, if you’re only measuring revenue, the food might be getting worse but
                        you’re making up for it with marketing or discounts or some other method.
                        Instead, it may be more effective to track how many customers finish their meal
                        or perhaps the percentage of customers who leave a generous tip.</p>
                    <p>The dark side of tracking a particular behavior is that we become driven by
                        the number rather than the purpose behind it. If your success is measured by
                        quarterly earnings, you will optimize sales, revenue, and accounting for
                        quarterly earnings. If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale,
                        you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, even if that means embracing
                        crash diets, juice cleanses, and fat-loss pills. The human mind wants to “win”
                        whatever game is being played.
                    </p>
                    <p>This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on working long hours
                        instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about getting ten
                        thousand steps than we do about being healthy. We teach for standardized tests
                        instead of emphasizing learning, curiosity, and critical thinking. In short, we
                        optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get
                        the wrong behavior</p>
                    <p>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist
                        Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it
                        ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you
                        and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is
                        simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our data-driven world, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue
                        anything ephemeral, soft, and difficult to quantify. We mistakenly think the
                        factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can
                        measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because
                        you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>All of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper place. It can
                        feel satisfying to record a habit and track your progress, but the measurement is
                        not the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to measure
                        progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your focus to something entirely
                        different.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is why nonscale victories can be effective for weight loss. The number
                        on the scale may be stubborn, so if you focus solely on that number, your
                        motivation will sag. But you may notice that your skin looks better or you wake
                        up earlier or your sex drive got a boost. All of these are valid ways to track your
                        improvement. If you’re not feeling motivated by the number on the scale,
                        perhaps it’s time to focus on a different measurement—one that gives you more
                        signals of progress</p>
                    <p>No matter how you measure your improvement, habit tracking offers a simple
                        way to make your habits more satisfying. Each measurement provides a little bit
                        of evidence that you’re moving in the right direction and a brief moment of
                        immediate pleasure for a job well done.

                    <p>One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.</p>
                    <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—

                    <p>Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your

                <h3>How an accountability partner can change everything</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>After serving as S a pilot in World War II, Roger Fisher attended Harvard Law School
                        and spent thirty-four years specializing in negotiation and conflict management.
                        He founded the Harvard Negotiation Project and worked with numerous
                        countries and world leaders on peace resolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic
                        compromises. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear war
                        escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most interesting idea</p>
                    <p>At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could prevent
                        nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting president would
                        have access to launch codes that could kill millions of people but would never
                        actually see anyone die because he would always be thousands of miles away.
                    </p>
                    <p>“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear] code
                        number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of
                        a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he
                        accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons,
                        the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill
                        one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens of millions
                        must die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an
                        innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.
                    </p>
                    <p>“When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God, that’s
                        terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He
                        might never push the button.’”</p>
                    <p>Throughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have
                        covered the importance of making good habits immediately satisfying. Fisher’s
                        proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law: Make it immediately unsatisfying.
                    </p>
                    <p>Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is
                        satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is
                        painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a
                        failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more
                        costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review
                        forces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a customer never
                        returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong
                        blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When
                        the consequences are severe, people learn quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p>The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to
                        prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost
                        to the action is a great way to reduce their odds.
                    </p>
                    <p>We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them
                        hard to abandon. The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to
                        increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can’t
                        be a gap between the action and the consequences.
                    </p>
                    <p>As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to
                        change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee.
                        Students show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance. We’ll jump
                        through a lot of hoops to avoid a little bit of immediate pain.</p>
                    <p>hange behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative
                        strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the cost of
                        procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of
                        laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. Getting fined for smoking in a
                        restaurant or failing to recycle adds consequence to an action. Behavior only
                        shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.
                    </p>
                    <p>In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence,
                        the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The more global,
                        intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence
                        individual behavior.

                    <p>Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any
                        bad habit: create a habit contract.
                    </p>
                    <h4>THE HABIT CONTRACT</h4>
                    <p>The first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. At the
                        time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a seat belt—
                        but that was all about to change.</p>
                    <p>Within five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today, wearing a
                        seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states. And it’s not just
                        the legislation, the number of people wearing seat belts has changed dramatically
                        as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans buckled up each time they got in
                        a car. In just over thirty years, there was a complete reversal in the habits of
                        millions of people.
                    </p>
                    <p>Laws and regulations are an example of how government can change our
                        habits by creating a social contract. As a society, we collectively agree to abide
                        by certain rules and then enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of
                        legislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning smoking inside
                        restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an example of a social contract shaping
                        our habits. The group agrees to act in a certain way, and if you don’t follow
                        along, you’ll be punished.
                    </p>
                    <p>Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a
                        habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or
                        written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and
                        the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then you find one or
                        two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract
                        with you</p>
                    <p>Bryan Harris, an entrepreneur from Nashville, Tennessee, was the first person
                        I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after the birth of his son, Harris
                        realized he wanted to shed a few pounds. He wrote up a habit contract between
                        himself, his wife, and his personal trainer. The first version read, “Bryan’s #1
                        objective for Q1 of 2017 is to start eating correctly again so he feels better, looks
                        better, and is able to hit his long-term goal of 200 pounds at 10% body fat.”</p>
                    <p>Below that statement, Harris laid out a road map for achieving his ideal
                        outcome:</p>
                    <p>Phase #1: Get back to a strict “slow-carb” diet in Q1.</p>
                    <p>Phase #2: Start a strict macronutrient tracking program in Q2.
                    </p>
                    <p>Phase #3: Refine and maintain the details of his diet and workout
                        program in Q3.</p>
                    <p>Finally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to his goal.
                        For example, “Write down all food that he consumes each day and weigh
                        himself each day.”
                    </p>
                    <p>And then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Bryan doesn’t do these two
                        items then the following consequence will be enforced: He will have to dress up
                        each workday and each Sunday morning for the rest of the quarter. Dress up is
                        defined as not wearing jeans, t-shirts, hoodies, or shorts. He will also give Joey
                        (his trainer) $200 to use as he sees fit if he misses one day of logging food.”
                        At the bottom of the page, Harris, his wife, and his trainer all signed the
                        contract</p>
                    <p>My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly formal and
                        unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Harris convinced me that signing the
                        contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “I
                        start slacking almost immediately.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Three months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Harris upgraded his goals.
                        The consequences escalated, too. If he missed his carbohydrate and protein
                        targets, he had to pay his trainer $100. And if he failed to weigh himself, he had
                        to give his wife $500 to use as she saw fit. Perhaps most painfully, if he forgot to
                        run sprints, he had to dress up for work every day and wear an Alabama hat the
                        rest of the quarter—the bitter rival of his beloved Auburn team.</p>
                    <p>The strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as accountability
                        partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly what to do each day,
                        Harris lost the weight.</p>
                    <p>To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in
                        the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to do exactly that.
                        Even if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply having an
                        accountability partner is useful. The comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or
                        song every day. She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend, which helps
                        them both stay accountable. Knowing that someone is watching can be a
                        powerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there
                        is an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as
                        untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your
                        promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to others.</p>
                    <p>You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in
                        Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a
                        tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m
                        lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t
                        malfunction.”</p>
                    <p>We are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We comb our
                        hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we know these
                        habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We want to get good grades and
                        graduate from top schools to impress potential employers and mates and our
                        friends and family. We care about the opinions of those around us because it
                        helps if others like us. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner or
                        signing a habit contract can work so well.</p>
                    <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
                    <p>The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it
                        unsatisfying.</p>
                    <p>We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.</p>
                    <p>An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We
                        care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others
                        to have a lesser opinion of us.</p>
                    <p>A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It
                        makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.</p>
                    <p>Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful
                        motivator.

                <h2>How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great</h2>
                <h3>The truth about talent(When genes matter and when they don't)</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Many people are familiar with Michael Phelps, who is widely considered to be one of
                        the greatest athletes in history. Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only
                        than any swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any sport.
                    </p>
                    <p>Fewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic
                        athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two
                        Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all
                        time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and
                        2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won
                        gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.
                    </p>
                    <p>These two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters, one
                        competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, they differ
                        significantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six
                        feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch difference in height, the two men
                        are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the
                        same length inseam on their pants</p>
                    <p>How is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height and a very
                        long torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs
                        and a short upper body, an ideal frame for distance running.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, imagine if these world-class athletes were to switch sports. Given his
                        remarkable athleticism, could Michael Phelps become an Olympic-caliber
                        distance runner with enough training? It’s unlikely. At peak fitness, Phelps
                        weighed 194 pounds, which is 40 percent heavier than El Guerrouj, who
                        competed at an ultralight 138 pounds. Taller runners are heavier runners, and
                        every extra pound is a curse when it comes to distance running. Against elite
                        competition, Phelps would be doomed from the start.
                    </p>
                    <p>Similarly, El Guerrouj might be one of the best runners in history, but it’s
                        doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer. Since 1976, the
                        average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is five
                        feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in
                        the men’s 100-meter freestyle swim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be
                        tall and have long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water.
                        El Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the pool.</p>
                    <p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of
                        competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and
                        business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when
                        they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the
                        pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the
                        odds are in your favor.
                    </p>
                    <p>Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people
                        are born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to discuss this fact. On
                        the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’s no fun to talk about things you
                        cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism makes it sound like
                        certain individuals are destined for success and others doomed to failure. But
                        this is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>The strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be easily
                        changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable
                        circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. If you
                        want to dunk a basketball, being seven feet tall is very useful. If you want to
                        perform a gymnastics routine, being seven feet tall is a great hindrance. Our
                        environment determines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural
                        talents. When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine
                        success</p>
                    <p>uccess.
                        This is true not just for physical characteristics but for mental ones as well.
                        I’m smart if you ask me about habits and human behavior; not so much when it
                        comes to knitting, rocket propulsion, or guitar chords. Competence is highly
                        dependent on context.
                    </p>
                    <p>The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they
                        are also well suited to the task. And this is why, if you want to be truly great,
                        selecting the right place to focus is crucial.
                    </p>
                    <p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of
                        opportunity. As physician Gabor Mate notes, “Genes can predispose, but they
                        don’t predetermine.” The areas where you are genetically predisposed to success
                        are the areas where habits are more likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct
                        your effort toward areas that both excite you and match your natural skills, to
                        align your ambition with your ability</p>
                    <p>The obvious question is, “How do I figure out where the odds are in my
                        favor? How do I identify the opportunities and habits that are right for me?” The
                        first place we will look for an answer is by understanding your personality.
                    </p>
                    <h4>HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS</h4>
                    <p>Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the
                        surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything from
                        the number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry
                        or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. There’s
                        a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing
                        authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stressful events, how proactive
                        or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during
                        sensory experiences like attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral
                        geneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now at the point where we
                        have stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we
                        literally can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by our genes.”</p>
                    <p>Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a
                        particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is
                        consistent from situation to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of
                        personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five
                        spectrums of behavior.</p>
                    <p>Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to
                        cautious and consistent on the other.
                    </p>
                    <p>Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and
                        spontaneous.
                    </p>
                    <p>Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved (you
                        likely know them as extroverts vs. introverts).
                    </p>
                    <p>Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and
                        detached.</p>
                    <p>Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable.
                    </p>
                    <p>All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for
                        instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the nursing
                        ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the researchers
                        tracked these children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward
                        the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away
                        were more likely to become introverts</p>
                    <p>People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm. They
                        also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an
                        important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act as a
                        natural antidepressant. You can easily imagine how someone with more
                        oxytocin might be inclined to build habits like writing thank-you notes or
                        organizing social events.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all
                        people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be
                        anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to
                        hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for
                        noticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues
                        in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.</p>
                    <p>Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt
                        that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences
                        make certain behaviors easier for some people than for others. You don’t have to
                        apologize for these differences or feel guilty about them, but you do have to
                        work with them. A person who scores lower on conscientiousness, for example,
                        will be less likely to be orderly by nature and may need to rely more heavily on
                        environment design to stick with good habits. (As a reminder for the less
                        conscientious readers among us, environment design is a strategy we discussed
                        in Chapters 6 and 12.)</p>
                    <p>The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your personality.*
                        People can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder, but if you prefer rock
                        climbing or cycling or rowing, then shape your exercise habit around your
                        interests. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you find that low-fat works
                        for you, then more power to you. If you want to read more, don’t be embarrassed
                        if you prefer steamy romance novels over nonfiction. Read whatever fascinates
                        you.* You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the
                        habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find
                        it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. This is the core idea
                        behind the 4th Law.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tailoring your habits to your personality is a good start, but this is not the end
                        of the story. Let’s turn our attention to finding and designing situations where
                        you’re at a natural advantage.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR</h4>
                    <p>Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for
                        maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost
                        anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to
                        you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at
                        that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because
                        they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get
                        rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them
                        happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a
                        virtuous cycle.</p>
                    <p>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a
                        struggle.</p>
                    <p>How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we covered in the
                        3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it
                        simply means they picked a habit that was too difficult. When a habit is easy,
                        you are more likely to be successful. When you are successful, you are more
                        likely to feel satisfied. However, there is another level to consider. In the longrun, if you
                        continue to advance and improve, any area can become challenging.
                        At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your
                        skillset. How do you figure that out?</p>
                    <p>The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a problem
                        with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every career, date
                        every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an
                        effective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit
                        trade-off.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In
                        relationships, it’s called dating. In college, it’s called the liberal arts. In business,
                        it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad
                        range of ideas, and cast a wide net.
                    </p>
                    <p>After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution
                        you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance
                        depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you
                        exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore,
                        explore, explore.</p>
                    <p>In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems
                        to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring
                        with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend
                        80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of
                        their choice, which has led to the creation of blockbuster products like AdWords
                        and Gmail.
                    </p>
                    <p>The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If you have
                        a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes more
                        sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good
                        amount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on
                        the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found
                        so far and get some results.</p>
                    <p>As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask
                        yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most
                        satisfying to you:</p>
                    <p>What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you
                        are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle
                        the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying
                        yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less
                        than it hurts others is the work you were made to do.</p>
                    <p>What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter
                        when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades
                        away. This blend of happiness and peak performance is what athletes and
                        performers experience when they are “in the zone.” It is nearly impossible
                        to experience a flow state and not find the task satisfying at least to some
                        degree</p>
                    <p>Where do I get greater returns than the average person? We are
                        continually comparing ourselves to those around us, and a behavior is more
                        likely to be satisfying when the comparison is in our favor. When I started
                        writing at jamesclear.com, my email list grew very quickly. I wasn’t quite
                        sure what I was doing well, but I knew that results seemed to be coming
                        faster for me than for some of my colleagues, which motivated me to keep
                        writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>What comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have
                        been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of
                        you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I
                        felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or
                        people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of
                        engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you
                        are headed in the right direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>To be honest, some of this process is just luck. Michael Phelps and Hicham El
                        Guerrouj were lucky to be born with a rare set of abilities that are highly valued
                        by society and to be placed in the ideal environment for those abilities. We all
                        have limited time on this planet, and the truly great among us are the ones who
                        not only work hard but also have the good fortune to be exposed to opportunities
                        that favor us.
                    </p>
                    <p>But what if you don’t want to leave it up to luck?
                        If you can’t find a game where the odds are stacked in your favor, create one.
                        Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind Dilbert, says, “Everyone has at least a few
                        areas in which they could be in the top 25% with some effort. In my case, I can
                        draw better than most people, but I’m hardly an artist. And I’m not any funnier
                        than the average standup comedian who never makes it big, but I’m funnier than
                        most people. The magic is that few people can draw well and write jokes. It’s the
                        combination of the two that makes what I do so rare. And when you add in my
                        business background, suddenly I had a topic that few cartoonists could hope to
                        understand without living it.”</p>
                    <p>When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By
                        combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it
                        easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for
                        years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the
                        game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors
                        their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.</p>
                    <p>In college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a combination
                        of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t smart enough to stand out
                        among the top physics or biology majors, so I created my own game. And
                        because it suited me—I was only taking the courses I was interested in—
                        studying felt like less of a chore. It was also easier to avoid the trap of
                        comparing myself to everyone else. After all, nobody else was taking the same
                        combination of classes, so who could say if they were better or worse?</p>
                    <p>Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics.
                        The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete
                        with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than the average arm wrestler, but
                        even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm wrestling because the arm wrestling
                        champ has very specific strength. Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted,
                        you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category.

                    <p>Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control
                        whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s
                        better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can
                        transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where
                        they are in your favor.

                    <h4>HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES
                    </h4>
                    <p>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us
                        what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend
                        our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and
                        which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the
                        better our strategy can be.
                    </p>
                    <p>Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus on
                        whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to
                        someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has
                        nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities.
                        People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the
                        effort required to get close to them.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work.
                        Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you
                        haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a
                        better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t
                        explain away their success as luck.</p>
                    <p>In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over
                        the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.
                        Work hard on the things that come easy.</p>

                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>In 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old
                        boy walked in and asked for a job. Labor laws were loose back then and the boy
                        managed to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.
                    </p>
                    <p>Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned
                        tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and tried out
                        simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not
                        performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on becoming a
                        comedian.</p>
                    <p>Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs around
                        Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He was rarely on
                        stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy
                        drinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night, he literally delivered
                        his stand-up routine to an empty club.
                    </p>
                    <p>It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better. His
                        first routines would only last one or two minutes. By high school, his material
                        had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a few years later, a ten-minute
                        show. At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He
                        had to read three poems during the show just to make the routine long enough,
                        but his skills continued to progress.</p>
                    <p>He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He took a
                        job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land his own appearances
                        on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being a regular
                        guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.</p>
                    <p>Finally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to fame. He
                        toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two cities in eighty days.
                        Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one show in
                        Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show in New York. He
                        catapulted to the top of his genre and became one of the most successful
                        comedians of his time.
                    </p>
                    <p>His name is Steve Martin.
                    </p>
                    <p>Martin’s story offers a fascinating perspective on what it takes to stick with
                        habits for the long run. Comedy is not for the timid. It is hard to imagine a
                        situation that would strike fear into the hearts of more people than performing
                        alone on stage and failing to get a single laugh. And yet Steve Martin faced this
                        fear every week for eighteen years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4
                        years spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.”</p>
                    <p>Why is it that some people, like Martin, stick with their habits—whether
                        practicing jokes or drawing cartoons or playing guitar—while most of us
                        struggle to stay motivated? How do we design habits that pull us in rather than
                        ones that fade away? Scientists have been studying this question for many years.
                        While there is still much to learn, one of the most consistent findings is that the
                        way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks
                        of “just manageable difficulty.”</p>
                    <p>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of
                        difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-yearold, you will
                        quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In
                        contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena
                        Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now consider playing tennis against someone who is your equal. As the game
                        progresses, you win a few points and you lose a few. You have a good chance of
                        winning, but only if you really try. Your focus narrows, distractions fade away,
                        and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. This is a challenge of
                        just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when
                        working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too
                        hard. Not too easy. Just right.
                    </p>
                    <h4>THE GOLDILOCKS RULE</h4>
                    <p>Martin’s comedy career is an excellent example of the Goldilocks Rule in
                        practice. Each year, he expanded his comedy routine—but only by a minute or
                        two. He was always adding new material, but he also kept a few jokes that were
                        guaranteed to get laughs. There were just enough victories to keep him
                        motivated and just enough mistakes to keep him working hard.</p>
                    <p>When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy
                        as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. This is
                        an idea we covered in detail while discussing the 3rd Law of Behavior Change.
                        Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to continue to
                        advance in small ways. These little improvements and new challenges keep you
                        engaged. And if you hit the Goldilocks Zone just right, you can achieve a flow
                        state.</p>
                    <p>A flow state is the experience of being “in the zone” and fully immersed in an
                        activity. Scientists have tried to quantify this feeling. They found that to achieve
                        a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability. In
                        real life it’s typically not feasible to quantify the difficulty of an action in this
                        way, but the core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of
                        just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems
                        crucial for maintaining motivation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly search for
                        challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to make enough progress
                        to stay motivated. Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay
                        attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps
                        the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement.</p>
                    <h4>HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON
                        YOUR GOALS</h4>
                    <p>After my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined a
                        weightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He had worked
                        with thousands of athletes during his long career, including a few Olympians. I
                        introduced myself and we began talking about the process of improvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked.
                        “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?”
                    </p>
                    <p>He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he
                        said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can
                        handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and
                        over.”</p>
                    <p>His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work
                        ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s
                        business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to
                        passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed
                        when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have
                        some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really
                        successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The
                        difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of
                        boredom.
                    </p>
                    <p>Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more
                        boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we
                        learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens even faster
                        than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in a row or publish a
                        couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much.
                        Things are going well. It’s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you’re in
                        a good place.</p>
                    <p>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with
                        habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as
                        our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty.
                        Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one
                        workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon
                        as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy
                        —even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire
                        novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as
                        much as those who are doing badly.”</p>
                    <p>Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that
                        provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn
                        provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these
                        experiences offer continual elements of surprise.
                    </p>
                    <p>In psychology, this is known as a variable reward.* Slot machines are the
                        most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and
                        then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This
                        variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and
                        accelerates habit formation.</p>
                    <p>Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward
                        people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will
                        change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we
                        already experience because they reduce boredom.</p>
                    <p>The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure.
                        Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t. You need
                        just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to
                        experience desire. This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If
                        you’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges of just manageable
                        difficulty is a good way to keep things interesting.</p>
                    <p>Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn’t
                        want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I
                        would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my
                        trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer. And if I flossed my teeth
                        each night and only sometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.</p>
                    <p>Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point,
                        everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have
                        to fall in love with boredom.</p>
                    <p>We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would
                        like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you
                        only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be
                        consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.</p>
                    <p>I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there
                        will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be
                        days when you don’t feel like showing up. When you’re at the gym, there will be
                        sets that you don’t feel like finishing. When it’s time to write, there will be days
                        that you don’t feel like typing. But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or
                        draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and
                        an amateur.
                    </p>
                    <p>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
                        Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose;
                        amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.</p>
                    <p>David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to
                        avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to be a fairweather athlete or
                        a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything. When a habit
                        is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood.
                        Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy
                        it, but they find a way to put the reps in.
                    </p>
                    <p>There have been a lot of sets that I haven’t felt like finishing, but I’ve never
                        regretted doing the workout. There have been a lot of articles I haven’t felt like
                        writing, but I’ve never regretted publishing on schedule. There have been a lot of
                        days I’ve felt like relaxing, but I’ve never regretted showing up and working on
                        something that was important to me.</p>
                    <p>The only way to become excellent is to be endlessly fascinated by doing the
                        same thing over and over. You have to fall in love with boredom.

                <h3>The downside of creating good habits</h3>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>Habits create the foundatioon for mastery. Y. In chess, it is only after the basic movements of the
                        pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the
                        game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space
                        for more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the
                        simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are
                        free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the
                        backbone of any pursuit of excellence.</p>
                    <p>However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition
                        develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you
                        become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomes
                        easier to let mistakes slide. When you can do it “good enough” on autopilot, you
                        stop thinking about how to do it better.</p>
                    <p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside
                        of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying
                        attention to little errors. You assume you’re getting better because you’re
                        gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—
                        not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been
                        mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.
                        </p>
                    <p>Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You don’t need
                        a system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tie your
                        shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits like these, good enough is
                        usually good enough. The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you
                        can spend it on what really matters.
                        </p>
                    <p>However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels
                        of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can’t repeat the same
                        things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not
                        sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and
                        deliberate practice.</p>
                    <p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p>
                    <p>To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. Basketball
                        players need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on to
                        mastering layups with their nondominant hand. Surgeons need to repeat the first
                        incision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed, so that they
                        can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery. But after one
                        habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and
                        begin building the next habit.
                        </p>
                    <p>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success,
                        repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as
                        the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. Old tasks
                        become easier the second time around, but it doesn’t get easier overall because
                        now you’re pouring your energy into the next challenge. Each habit unlocks the
                        next level of performance. It’s an endless cycle.
                        </p>
                    <p>Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of
                        your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is
                        precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—
                        right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming
                        comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.
                        The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.
                        </p>
                        <h4>HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS</h4>
                    <p>In 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented basketball teams
                        ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that way. The team started the
                        1985–1986 NBA season with an astounding 29–5 record. “The pundits were
                        saying that we might be the best team in the history of basketball,” head coach
                        Pat Riley said after the season. Surprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986
                        playoffs and suffered a season-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals.
                        The “best team in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA
                        championship.</p>
                    <p>After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his players
                        had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to see flashes of
                        brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the Lakers to
                        play up to their potential, night after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a
                        plan to do exactly that, a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or
                        CBE.
                        </p>
                    <p>“When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their
                        basketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking Their
                        Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him
                        into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain and then
                        improve upon his averages.”</p>
                    <p>After determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley added a key
                        step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the
                        course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best
                        Effort.” Similar to the British Cycling team that we discussed in Chapter 1, the
                        Lakers sought peak performance by getting slightly better each day.
                        </p>
                    <p>Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or
                        statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally and
                        physically.” Players got credit for “allowing an opponent to run into you when
                        you know that a foul will be called against him, diving for loose balls, going
                        after rebounds whether you are likely to get them or not, helping a teammate
                        when the player he’s guarding has surged past him, and other ‘unsung hero’
                        deeds.”
                        </p>
                    <p>As an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at the
                        time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game.
                        Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose ball (+1).
                        Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game.
                        The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we subtract
                        the 5 turnovers (34–5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33 minutes played.
                        </p>
                    <p>29/33 = 0.879
                    </p>
                    <p>Magic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated for all
                        of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was asked to
                        improve by 1 percent over the season. Riley compared each player’s current
                        CBE to not only their past performances but also those of other players in the
                        league. As Riley put it, “We rank team members alongside league opponents
                        who play the same position and have similar role definitions.”</p>
                    <p>Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top performers in
                        the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and measured them
                        against the corresponding players on his own roster. Solid, reliable players
                        generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players scored at least 800. Magic
                        Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over
                        1,000.”</p>
                    <p>The Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical
                        comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of November
                        1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether they were doing
                        better or worse than at the same point last season. Then we showed them how
                        their performance figures for December 1986, stacked up against November’s.”</p>
                    <p>The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they were
                        NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to another title as
                        the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back NBA
                        championships. Afterward, he said, “Sustaining an effort is the most important
                        thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things
                        right, then do them the same way every time.”
                        </p>
                    <p>The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and review.
                        The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most out of what
                        they had, and made sure their habits improved rather than declined.</p>
                    <p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits
                        because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible
                        paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create
                        rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining
                        whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.</p>
                    <p>Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review,
                        and the process doesn’t have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge is
                        one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold medalist. He
                        still takes notes after every practice in which he reviews his training for the day
                        and searches for areas that can be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer
                        Katie Ledecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10 and includes notes on
                        her nutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted by other
                        swimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over her notes and adds his
                        thoughts.</p>
                    <p>It’s not just athletes, either. When comedian Chris Rock is preparing fresh
                        material, he will first appear at small nightclubs dozens of times and test
                        hundreds of jokes. He brings a notepad on stage and records which bits go over
                        well and where he needs to make adjustments. The few killer lines that survive
                        will form the backbone of his new show.</p>
                    <p>I know of executives and investors who keep a “decision journal” in which
                        they record the major decisions they make each week, why they made them, and
                        what they expect the outcome to be. They review their choices at the end of each
                        month or year to see where they were correct and where they went wrong.</p>
                    <p>Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them.
                        Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and
                        make course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley adjusting the effort
                        of his players on a nightly basis. You don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it
                        becomes ineffective.
                        </p>
                    <p>Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review. Each
                        December, I perform an Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. I
                        tally my habits for the year by counting up how many articles I published, how
                        many workouts I put in, how many new places I visited, and more.* Then, I
                        reflect on my progress (or lack thereof) by answering three questions:</p>
                    <p>What went well this year?
                    </p>
                    <p>What didn’t go so well this year?
                    </p>
                    <p>What did I learn?</p>
                    <p>Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report.
                        Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize
                        where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to
                        revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance
                        with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward
                        being the type of person I wish to become.*</p>
                    <p>My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:</p>
                    <p>What are the core values that drive my life and work?</p>
                    <p>How am I living and working with integrity right now?</p>
                    <p>How can I set a higher standard in the future?</p>
                    <p>These two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but they
                        are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that happens
                        when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit my
                        desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of
                        person I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on
                        new challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the
                        fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful
                        because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice
                        is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every
                        imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback.
                        Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You
                        aren’t aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your
                        teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing
                        yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important
                        changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to
                        view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.
                        </p>
                    <p>Finally, reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most
                        important aspects of behavior change: identity.</p>
                        <h4>HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK</h4>
                    <p>In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your
                        desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same
                        beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against
                        you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your
                        weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest
                        downsides of building habits.</p>
                    <p>The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our
                        identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this in
                        every industry. The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and
                        sticks with her tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is
                        committed to doing things “his way.” The surgeon who dismisses the ideas of
                        her younger colleagues. The band who produces a mind-blowing first album and
                        then gets stuck in a rut. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes
                        to grow beyond it.
                        </p>
                    <p>One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an
                        overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham,
                        “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less
                        capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie everything up in
                        being the point guard or the partner at the firm or whatever else, then the loss of
                        that facet of your life will wreck you. If you’re a vegan and then develop a
                        health condition that forces you to change your diet, you’ll have an identity crisis
                        on your hands. When you cling too tightly to one identity, you become brittle.
                        Lose that one thing and you lose yourself.</p>
                    <p>For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my identity.
                        After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself. When you spend your
                        whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears, who are you now?</p>
                    <p>Military veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If your
                        identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when
                        your period of service ends? For many business owners, their identity is
                        something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have
                        spent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after
                        you sell the company?</p>
                    <p>The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that
                        you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role
                        changes.
                        </p>
                    <p>“I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally
                        tough and loves a physical challenge.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is
                        disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and
                        creates things.”</p>
                    <p>When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like
                        water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing
                        circumstances rather than against them.</p>
                    <p>The following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly:
                    </p>
                    <p>Men are born soft and supple;</p>
                    <p>dead, they are stiff and hard.</p>
                    <p>Plants are born tender and pliant;</p>
                    <p>dead, they are brittle and dry.</p>
                    <p>Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible
                    </p>
                    <p>is a disciple of death.</p>
                    <p>Whoever is soft and yielding
                    </p>
                    <p>is a disciple of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>The hard and stiff will be broken.</p>
                    <p>The soft and supple will prevail.</p>
                    <p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us
                        into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is
                        shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so
                        you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still
                        serving you.
                        </p>
                    <p>A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote.</p>
                    <h4>Chapter Summary</h4>
                    <p>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The
                        downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.</p>
                    <p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery
                    </p>
                    <p>Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious
                        of your performance over time.</p>
                    <p>The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow
                        beyond it.</p>
